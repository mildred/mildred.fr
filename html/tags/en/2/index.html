<div class="excerpt">
  <p>Hi,</p>

<p>It's 5 am in the morning, and I can't sleep and I'm in slight pain. I spent all
the afternoon of Monday sleeping 'cause the last days at the hospital weren't so
great. I was released from the Hospital at Monday noon.</p>

<p>Sunday, I hoped to have the internal packing inside my vagina removed, It was
uncomfortable to have especially considering that my bowels had started to fill
up again and the packing took extra space. I also didn't feel much like eating.
I was not in a so good mood.</p>

<p>The night before was really painful (from Friday to Saturday). I had some sharp
pain that scared my boyfriend to death. I was sleeping gently, then, few moments
before a nurse came to give me the pills to take before bedtime, I woke up in
intense pain. I cried my lungs out, gasping for my breath, and scared everybody.</p>

<p>First, I took the bedtime pills that contained paracetamol, then the nurse came
with the standard painkillers (two pills of paracetamol 500) and finally she
came back with a huge (said my boyfriend) syringe of equivalent to morphine. I
was then left panting for few minutes before things came back to normal. This is
not usual but it can happen, beware.</p>

<p>I then called my parents (think so) to talk things out. Elie was very frustrated
not to be able to help me in any possible way, but sometimes you have to deal
things by yourself, and knowing your love mate is around is enough. Just like a
woman giving birth.</p>

<p>The next day, I didn't eat much, or not at all depending of your point of view,
my stomach was not agreeing with all the medicine I had to take (five pills
after each meals, even the one I didn't took, and about four or five at bedtime,
plus all the painkillers).</p>

<p>The night from Sunday to Monday was difficult al well, I had pain in my bladder,
and didn't want to take the paracetamol because on my scrambled stomach. I
called my parents at 4 am in the morning (11 pm in France) to understand that I
haven't drunk enough water. Of course, my IV had been removed. So there was no
way for the body to drain all the toxins from the pills. From 5 am to 6:30 I
drunk 1.5 litter and I was released from the pain.</p>

<p>At 6:30 came the torture I was expecting, drink from 1 to 2 litters of water
with the catheter (<em>sonde urinaire pour les fran√ßais</em>) blocked. So the pee
couldn't come out and I could train my bladder to grow, since it had shrunk.
This was a very difficult exercise I found very difficult to do given all the
water I drunk before. Then, at 8, the catheter was released and the pain
removed.</p>

<p>Then, came Dr Suporn, he removed the vaginal packing (10 or 20 meters of gauze
bandage roll) and he proceeded to the first dilation. That is having the medium
dilator inserted up to 7 inches for 30 minutes (starting when you arrive at full
depth). I have to do that twice a day for at least 6 months if not more. After a
year, the regime can be eased a little. This was a little bit uncomfortable
only, as the dilator is constantly pressing the end of the vagina, but not so
hard.</p>

<p>Then I slept.</p>

<p>My passport to be released from the hospital was to pee all right, so I had to
drink more and have a nurse confirm that I could pee. It doesn't spray in the
right direction still, because of the swelling, but I can pee ok.</p>

<p>All this time, I still felt nausea, and I effectively threw up few minutes
before leaving the hospital and just after a nurse gave me an injection of
anti-nausea. Ironic. Can't stand medication I tell you. By the way, even if I
didn't escape injection of painkillers before removing the packing, I escaped
the after-breakfast pills, so that was good. Only the smell of the pills made me
nauseous.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Hotel, I was greeted by
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/valerietr38/blog">Valerie</a> who seems to look fine, and I
then went to my room to sleep it off. Elie ordered room service, and I ate a
portion of a greek salad before a nurse from the clinic came to help me dilate a
second time by myself. I also escaped the pills this time. Then I slept again
and at wakeup I had a wonderful dream, and my nausea was almost gone. I ate
another greek salad without dressing for dinner and this time took my pills
(only the necessary, antibiotics and anti-swelling, I left the painkillers off).</p>

<p>I finally took the painkillers this night, the ones that are small.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <p>On the bathroom, you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hybiscrub soap</li>
<li>Betadine</li>
<li>Drinking water</li>
<li>Syrnge</li>
</ul>


<p>On the bedroom, you need at hand disposition (on the bed itself):</p>

<ul>
<li>Dilator</li>
<li>Condoms</li>
<li>KY Jelly</li>
<li>Mirror</li>
<li>Timer</li>
<li>Bed protection, plastic strap</li>
<li>Somthing to relax you during 30 minutes</li>
<li>Cotton balls and betadine (dressing kit)</li>
<li>Dermazine cream</li>
<li>Trash can</li>
<li>Basic cleaning material (paper)</li>
<li>Glasses</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Blanket if you might be cold (not in Thailand)</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, here is how to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shower and use hibiscrub soap on the vaginal area</li>
<li>Prepare the bed with the plastic and hygenic bed protection</li>
<li>Put the plastic strap so that you would sit on it</li>
<li>Lie down on the bed, knees down, relaxed</li>
<li>Put a condom on the medium dilator</li>
<li>Put a lot of KY jelly on the dilator and some on the vaginal opening</li>
<li>Insert the dilator slowly, the head directed down (don't go into the
urethra)</li>
<li>Push until 7 inches, you should feel pressure. You can keep the dilator in
using the plastic strap you sat on</li>
<li>Wait 30 minutes</li>
<li>Remove the dilator slowly</li>
<li>Go wash the vaginal area in the shower, you need a syringe</li>
<li>Use 3 full syringes of drinking water and insert the water in the vaginal
opening. Don't try to get the water on the end on the vagina, just wash the
opening.</li>
<li>Use a syringe with 5 graduations (0.5 ml) of betadine and use drinking water
to fill the rest of the syringe (50 ml). Wash the vaginal opening the same
way.</li>
<li>Use hybiscrub soap to gently wash the vaginal area.</li>
<li>Back on the bed, apply betadine on the scar lines with a cotton ball (in the
dressing kit)</li>
<li>Apply Dermazine antiseptic cream on the clitoris and inside the labia minora</li>
</ol>


<p>And you're set, do that twice a day.</p>

                  <p>Yesterday, everything went fine. I just finished dilation that took and hour and
                  a half, taking my time. Elie went to a trip to Pattaya organized by the clinic,
                  and I have all the day to myself.</p>
                  
                  <p>During dilation, I listened to Karunesh, relaxing music, and read a little but
                  of the Hannah Montanna like story:
                  <a href="http://bigclosetr.us/topshelf/book/16505/sarah-carerra">Sarah Carrera</a></p>
                  
                  <p>It was ok, I reached 7" without mich difficulty, but I had to take care to have
                  everything reachable, including the mirror since I was alone. Just a nurse from
                  the clinic came at the beginning to check things up and left me alone. Daily
                  visit.</p>
                  
                  <p>With the mirror, you can't place it to near since you need place for the
                  dilator, beware.</p>
                  
                  <p>I'm fine and in a good mood, I can start my day now.</p>

                  <p>The equivalent of morphine was <em>dynastat 40mg</em> (I don't know why 40mg since
                  it is supposed to be injections, but perhaps if was 40mg in the syringe)</p>
                  
                  <p>Now, I take after each meals:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                  <li>antibiotics: I have 20 pills of <em>Ciprofloxacin 500mg</em></li>
                  <li>swelling reducer: I have 30 pills of <em>dangen 5mg</em> (if I can read well)</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  
                  <p>And Dr Suporn advised me to take medication to help bowel movements: <em>Prolax</em> at
                  bed time. He told me that if I noticed bleeding, I should stop. I also just
                  noticed that the instructions is to take two pills a day, and I took only one. I
                  think I will stick to one pill as I don't have major problems.</p>
                  
                  <p>I also use hybiscrub soap, which is antiseptic surgical soap. I was advised not
                  to use it too much as it might not be good for the skin. So only before and
                  after dilation.</p>
                  
                  <p>I apply antiseptic cream inside the labia minora: Dermazin which says it is 1%
                  Micronized Silver Sulfadiazine. It is also indicated for treatments of burns. I
                  apply this every time I wash the vaginal area (usually with tap water, I was
                  instructed not to try to clean too much).</p>

                  <p>I ordered fish and chips without fish ... A nice way to order french fries and
                  salad. Because everyone is in Pattaya, I could discuss with other people, from
                  UK actually and Australia. Everyone is very nice and it's good to know I will

                  <p>Dr Suporn stopped surgeries for some time to take vacations, well deserved. So
                  he can spend time with his family. And as time passes, there is less and less
                  people around. This also means the clinic staff has more time and appointments
                  would often be earlier. That's why Aey came just when I started dilating this
                  morning. I left the door open for her (and wrote a note).</p>

                  <p>I stopped hormones one week before the trip. Now, I'm completely off hormones,
                  like a menopausal woman. I think I feel the effects, I'm not sure but I
                  sometimes feels very hot, at other times quite normal. Difficult to manage.</p>
                  
                  <p>By the way, most of the time I stay naked. Just when I go out or I answer the

  <p>So, I'm fine, well, in a good mood. The days follows and are similar. Dilation
is ok even though I must go in a deep relaxation state. I think I shouldn't try
to sleep these moments and instead try to meditate as much as possible (stay in
the presence)</p>

<p>My farther told me that it might be easier to find the nature of mind as I have
accomplished quite a lot of what I wanted and I enter a peaceful state of
accomplishment.</p>

<p>Good news as well, <strong>I'm lactating.</strong> I'm not joking but it happened. My
boyfriend sucked on my right breast and he felt a salty taste, and rightly, some
mild escape from my breasts after some stimulation. I couldn't possibly feed a
baby yet, but that's a start. It might be the lack of hormones (stopped one week
before the trip) or the medication. But Elie said he felt that taste even
before.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's fun to play with. I'll show you some photos.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <p>This morning I had a revision to remove necrosed skin, white skin that was dead
tissue and the black necrosed skin. The goal was not to remove the white skin
that is in the process of healing but it must have been removed because I can't
see it anymore.</p>

<p>My labia minora looks smaller now, he says that with time, both labias will get
to similar sizes. Anyway.</p>

<p>This morning at 9:30, I went to the clinic, washed the area with hybiscrub soap
and put on the robe for the operation. I had Dr Suporn look at the area to see
how it had evolved and he noticed that it was healing fine but there was still
two necrosed areas that he still wanted to remove. He's not forgetting that I'm
leaving Thailand in a week.</p>

<p>He put on some anesthetic cream to numb the skin and an adhesive plastic to hold
it in place, then I waited for the revision upstairs. It took place at 11:15 and
lasted 15 to 20 minutes (the assistants had already prepared everything when Dr
Suporn entered). I had an injection to further numb the area that I didn't feel,
and it continued with, I imagine, cutting and threading. I felt the threads, or
more exactly, the vibration they made in my body.</p>

<p>And that was it. Cream was applied and I was downstairs to change to my usual
clothes and get back to the hotel. I could have been taken using the van but I
felt I could go walking, so I did.</p>

<p>I don't recognize myself anymore, the area where there was necrosed skin had
completely disappeared. Apart from that I feel ok except that I was't hungry at
noon so I didn't eat. Now I'm a bit hungry.</p>

<p>Moral is good. I have to dilate once more tonight (not before) and I might try
the largest dilator Sunday or Monday. 15 minutes for the medium dilator since
full depth, then try the largest for another 15 minutes.</p>

  <p>Wow, it's been a long time. As usual I'll tell you what happened for me. I know
this might read technical but I find it important to recall everything so that
other after me knows what they are signing for. This doesn't matter much as
personally, I don't think you could get this idea out of my head, but ...
Better be prepared.</p>

<p>Right now, I just finished my morning dilation (yes, I finished it at 1 pm) and
had a light snack. Now, let's go into the past:</p>

<p><strong><em>Sunday, 24th October 2010</em></strong></p>

<p>Ok, I just finished the 24 hours delay after my revision. The doctor told me I
could start using the largest dilator (diameter 34mm) soon and for the midday
dilation, I tried. I was told that I might not get my full 7 inches, but I could
(minus a few millimeters, but you are told not to care about millimeters). So,
that's good :)</p>

<p>I didn't tried it in the morning as the morning dilation is the most difficult.</p>

<p><strong><em>Monday, 25th October 2010</em></strong></p>

<p>Morning dilation ok, breakfast ok. Back to the hotel room at 10 when I get the
visit from a nurse. Today, around 1 pm, √âmilie-Marie, my friend, must come at
the airport and the clinic has arranged to get her. I ask if I can go greet her
and I was told I should hurry 'cause the driver is leaving right now.</p>

<p>Interrupting everything, I prepare and go to the hotel lobby. We wait until the
driver comes. He was waiting as well but didn't recognize us. Anyway, we go to
Bangkok. This time, no highway. We use the normal road.</p>

<p>Just to get you a picture, the highway and the normal road use the same path.
The highway is just located about 40 meters above. The only difference, apart
from the fact that the highway only have a few exits and no possibility to turn
back, is the quality of the road. The highway is perfect with 3 lanes for each
direction. The road is just as wide but the left lane (remember, we drive on the
left) is just anything but the tarmac it should be, and the right lane can
contain stopped cars that want to turn back. And sometimes, the whole road
disappears and becomes just a very bumpy track.</p>

<p>The rest of the week passes by, with many things to do. And I get very tried.
But that's life.</p>

<p><strong><em>Friday, 29th October 2010</em></strong></p>

<p>We leave tonight and we had the opportunity to get to every mall possible around
town. I feel sad. In the morning I get my final checkup with Dr Suporn, and I
realize that's the last time I saw him. He says everything is find and gives me
the final instructions.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I ordered flowers at the clinic. In the afternoon I am to go the
hospital a last time to give them to the nurses that were so kind the first
week. We go by tuk-tuk and take the lift to the 9th floor. Everyone is very kind
and very happy to see me back. I feel I'll have a duty of postcards when I go
back to France. We take photos and sadly, I have to leave.</p>

<p>Instead of going to the hotel, I stay at the clinic and realize once again
that's going to be the last time at the clinic. After, I have a dilation, and
must go down to the hotel lobby to get to the airport. I stay here and cry
everything out for about an hour. Of course, everyone is concerned about me. I
wish I had time to talk to people about their lives and whatever they wanted to
talk about. I just didn't have the opportunity.</p>

<p>I get the last photos using Elie's mobile phone. Very bad quality, but I love
these photos.</p>

<p>I get back.</p>

<p>I dilate.</p>

<p>I go down to the lobby after having finished packing everything (difficult).</p>

<p>Danny is here to get us to the airport and leaves us there. I say good bye.</p>

<p>I ask for a wheelchair and get through everything.</p>

<p>In the plane, I get the front seats. The plane is not full so that was possible.
It's very comfortable 'cause I can stand up and still be in front of my seat.
The plane's (Boeing 777-300) toilets aren't that comfortable especially to wash
the area and apply Dermazine cream. But I get by.</p>

<p><strong><em>Saturday, 30th October 2010</em></strong></p>

<p>Paris, we got to sleep ok. The plane left at midnight (Bangkok time) so that's
wasn't so hard. I get a wheelchair again and ask for the medical center to get a
micro dilation. That's the same terminal as the train station, lucky me. I get
to dilate in a hurry only getting near 7 inches with the smallest, but that's
going to make it easier afterwards.</p>

<p>I take the train in a hurry again and leave Paris.</p>

<p>Lyon, I take another train to get home.</p>

<p>Home (my parents'), I eat lunch, dilate, sleep, dilate, sleep and that's Sunday.</p>

<p><strong><em>Friday, 5th November 2010</em></strong></p>

<p>We get home all right.</p>

<p>Dilations starts to get difficult. So with time, I get to have the following changes: In the morning I use the smallest dilator first that I insert until 7" and release, and I get to do the insertion all by myself. This way, I can control the insertion and I can do that painlessly. The final (half) inch is just the critical zone where I have to push and where it hurts a bit. But taking time has the advantage of making it possible to do it with little pain.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sunday, 7th November 2010</em></strong></p>

<p>We invited all the close family to show the photos. Dilation was difficult after everyone left. Perhaps because we were tried and I mistook the medium dilator for the largest. Of course it couldn't enter. Combine that with the TV on and you have a super lengthy session that spanned from 9:45 to 0:30. Sleeping was <strong>very</strong> good afterwards.</p>
