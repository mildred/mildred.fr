  <p>Bonjour,</p>

<p>J'ai commencé ce blog la toute première fois pour parler de sujets techniques,
pouvoir m'exprimer et clarifier mes idées en même temps, partager des sujets que
je pense intéressants.</p>

<p>Je vais ajouter un nouveau volet à ma prose et détailler mon opération
imminente. Comme beaucoup avant moi l'on fait, je veux partager mon expérience
pour que celles qui me suivront ait une idée de ce qui peut les attendre.</p>

<hr />

<p>I started this blog to talk about technical subjects that I cared about. I don't
wish to expose my entire private life on these pages, but I feel it's important
to be able to talk about topics you care about. Computer Science is such a
topic. I also wanted to be able to write articles about things I did in order to
explain my developpments.</p>

<p>Now, I'm going to add another subject: my surgery. It will take place the 4th of
October, next monday. And I really wanted to share all of these information like
many did before me. I hope this might help.</p>

<p>That's about it, some posts might not appear on the front page as they might not
be suitable for everyone to see. You can always access them through the tag
pages.</p>

  <p>I arrived to Thailand fine, that was yesterday around 6 am (local time). Just
add 5 hours to the European time (CEST) and you get the time in Thailand. The
plane was not so comfortable, considering you had to stay 11 hours in the same
seat, but the service was very good. We had a vegetarian meal so that we were
served first, and we got two of them. One at the departure, one at the arrival.
Plus a sandwich and drinks.</p>

<p>This was the occasion for me to watch the film <em>Prince of Persia</em> again, this
time in English. Fortunately, I already have seen this film, otherwise I might
not have understood much. The plane's noise was loud and covering the sound.
The same way, PA messages were difficult to hear and understand.</p>

<p>The plane landed fine and we went to the airport ... immigration followed by
collecting luggage, then we went to where the clinic staff awaited us. They were
very nice, and speaking a good English. When we left the airport, we were
assaulted by the air which was hot and wet. Not so surprising, but not usual for
us, Europeans. Then, off to the van, direction Chonburi, which was cold and dry
due to the air conditioning.</p>

<p>I received a letter welcoming me to Thailand and with the appointment times. All
very beautiful.</p>

<p>The landscape is very different than France, there are many more trees, but many
more buildings as well. All very wide. And the roads are huge. Did I mention
that they drive on the left of the road (and the wheel is on the right). This
might take some time getting used to, fortunately I don't have to drive.</p>

<p>We arrived at the hotel, and checked in. The room is spacious and good looking.
The only drawback is the mattress is not good quality at all, says Elie. It's an
old sprung mattress. Never mind.</p>

<p>I asked for Valerie's room but I didn't get the confirmation until 9 am, by
phone. At that time I was asleep, until noon. The afternoon, the program changed
and I had to do a complete physical checkup at 1:30 pm. I just had time to take
a shower, remove few offending hair and dress up until I went to see Valerie and
I had to hurry downstairs.</p>

<p>Bow accompanied us to the hospital and I had complete physical checkup. Blood
stampings, X-rays of the chest area and an electro-cardiogram. All went well,
except the confusion on my first name as ever. Shanti versus Dominique which is
the real first name (on the passport) but not my usual name. Anyway.</p>

<div style="clear: both"></div>


<p>Then, I went to the clinic, and waited. I had the opportunity to rest a little,
and send a short e-mail before I had to go to see the clinic's psychiatrist. I
had to draw a person and a landscape, later describe them. And describe my
condition. How I was during childhood, ...</p>

<p>I received a beautiful booklet describing the operation and after-care, a
beautiful gift made of jasmine flowers and a box containing ... dilators. I then
went to my appointment with Dr Suporn.</p>

<p>He said that there was plenty of material and it should all go well. He
confirmed that my admission to the hospital was on Sunday afternoon and
explained the details of the operations.</p>

<p>We went back to the hotel, it was raining the 5pm rain. Very hot rain. We took
the van just to do 200 meters, I might argue on that. But I understand, we are
very well cared of here. We then visited the hotel and had an evening meal with
the other French patients around. And go to sleep.</p>

<p>I made it short, sorry, but it's already 12:30 pm and I still have to take a
shower.</p>

<p>Everyone is nice and very attentive. Today, I have the day off to visit, buy a
few essentials and contact everyone using the SIP account from free.fr that I
made work using the Twinkle software (Ekiga doesn't send your voice, I suppose
due to codec issues).</p>

  <p>Yesterday, after noon when we ate at the Hotel's restaurant, we went to town to
go shop a little. Finally, we spent the entire afternoon in a mall where there
were many shops. We bought:</p>

<ul>
<li>two SIM cards for our mobile phones</li>
<li>a buddha figurine</li>
<li>clothes</li>
</ul>


<p>The mall has four floors with many different shops, cinemas, ... I don't know
how I can tell about it, probably best if you come visit. Things aren't very
cheap, but still cheaper than in France. Elie says things costs half the price
in France.</p>

<p>To give you an idea, 40 baht (THB) is approximately 1 euro. The SIM card costs
from 50 baht to 99 baht, each call costs 2 baht for the first minute, and then,
0.5 baht per minute. The top we bought costs around 399 bahts, around 10 euros.
A typical dish at the Hotel's restaurant costs from 150 baht to 300 baht.</p>

<p>Anyway, when we left the mall, it was raining, and the sun was set. Back at the
hotel, I worked to buy the domain mildred.fr and a hosting service to host the
blog. I couldn't update the website on free.fr from Thailand, access denied. At
the same time, Elie went to buy a pizza with fried fries and fried onions rolls
(these taste very good by the way) that we ate in the room.</p>

<p>Today, we awoke at 9 am, still early from us who still suffer lightly from jet
lag, and went downstairs to have our first breakfast in the hotel. Yesterday, we
woke up at 11:30 am. Far too late. I also learned that I had to be available at
11 am to be admitted to the hospital. We just had time to eat, prepare, and
hurry to the lobby.</p>

<p>The hospital is very modern, we were admitted, and I had a plastic bracelet
attached around my arm, with my name on it. On the 9th floor (<strong>room 902, I was
mistaken before</strong>), we have the view on the sea. The room is big, clean, and I
would be tempted to add beautiful, but it's an hospital room after all.</p>

<p>We had to make our choice of meal for noon and afternoon on a menu, and I was
able to add that we were vegetarian, so the dishes don't contain any meat. We
ate, and I spent the afternoon putting photos on the blog, and doing other
things. The afternoon meal was at 5 pm and I just ordered a vegetable soup. I do
like it, more than the tomato soup that taste lake ketchup (that I distaste).</p>

<p>Just before 9 pm, I had to be prepared for the operation tomorrow. I had an
enema <em>(lavement en français)</em>, not very nice to have if you ask me. And I had
to have my genitals shaved. That's where I am at now. I just followed that by a
shower, including shampoo that I won't have the opportunity to have until next
week.</p>

<p>I feel ok, I would have expected nervousness perhaps, but no. Now, it's 10:20 pm
and I am going to sleep soon. I was given a sleep pill if ever I would find hard
to go to sleep, but I don't think I'll use it.</p>

<p>I'm ready for tomorrow, the schedule is to be waken up from 6 am to 7 am, take a
shower using surgical soap, and go to the operation theater around 8:30 to 9 am.
Then, follows 5 hours of operation, 1 hour of waking up and I shall be around at
3 pm, and I'll perhaps call around noon for the people in Europe.</p>

<p>Good night :)</p>

<p>Shanti</p>

  <p>It's today, I was just waken up by a nurse. I have one hour and a bit more to
prepare. That means take a shower and use the surgical soap.</p>

<p>I'm ok, all find. Just slightly nervous. But that's a normal reaction for such a
big operation.</p>

<p>I should go now.</p>

  <p>I'm alive</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay but I was in no condition to post before. Even now,stuck on
my bed, it"s not easy. My operation went well, this Monday morning. When I woke
up in the recovery room, I had a mask to help me breathe, with a lot of cream
(like gloss) to make it stick better I suppose. Before the op., I was wheeled
into the operating theater. My boyfriend stayed with me until I entered the
theater. I was almost crying.</p>

<p>When I woke up, I felt fine and I must have kept asking when I will go to my
room. I don't remember being wheeled back. Arrived, I felt fine and phoned to
Elie, my boyfriend as he wasn't here. It was 2:45 pm He didn't expect that I
would wake up so soon. He came a little after. I also phoned my parents using
the freephonie SIP account. I was still under the effect of anesthesia, so I had
a very small voice.</p>

<p>Pain was ok, I didn't have much (but I was under morphine). This apparently
caused me redness so they later switched to something else. With time, i felt
less and less pain. Now, it's only pressure under the dressings, nothing more.
But they still give me paracetamol I think.</p>

<p>Next morning, the anesthetist came to confirm everything was all right. She
indeed switch from morphine and also had to inject me anti-inflammatory because
my blood was clotting a bit more than usual, but still in the normal range. She
also told me that at first she couldn't insert the breathing tube in my throat
because my throat was too thin, so she had to insert a smaller tube, 7.5 inner
diameter. That's probably why I have I fairer voice.</p>

<p>Later, Dr Suporn visited me, and quickly said that I could move, it was good for
blood circulation. Legs, torso, arms ... And stated again the no sexual taught
motto. Then, the day passed quickly with me eating, sleeping eating and sleeping
again, probably because of the sleep pills.</p>

<p>I'll leave you here, I have to go down to a more comfortable position.</p>

  <p>Continuing ... I'm not so sleepy anymore, but still in bed. Today, they removed
my IV and I should be able to walk. Anyway, let's start from the beginning.</p>

<p>After the operation, I was very pale, gray lips and the like. I remember the
oxygen mask I had at the time and the cream (like gloss I remember to think)
that came with it. Not much else. Back in the hospital room, I called my
boyfriend who taught I would still be asleep, he came soon after, greeting me.</p>

<p>I slept with Jib helping me during the night to move in bed, and with
everything. She was very considerate (like everyone at the clinic)</p>

<p>Next morning, the anesthetist ... well I already talked about that and I want to
say something else while I can write. I start to have pain already.</p>

<p>Days followed, I felt better and better, that's good. Sleep, order menu, eat
food I don't want to eat ('cause I don't want to eat anything even if hungry).
Cold french fried passed rather well for they taste close to nothing. I like
fruits as well. For us vegetarians, the menu is rather limited.</p>

<p>On the last night I slept with the dressings, that is the night of 7-8 Oct, I
started to feel pain, but surprisingly on my right ankle on the right side.
Brief and sharp. I was told I didn't exercise much but I also heard such
descriptions of pain related to nerves regrowing. But I didn't have surgery on
my ankle.</p>

<p>I also had a terrible nightmare (I never had in years) where I left my hospital
bed, still with bandages, chasing something. And I was trying to get back to bed
before the nurses could tell me off. I woke up shivering, and sweating. So much
so I asked the nurse to give me painkillers injections (some equivalent to
morphine). I has another shot in the morning.</p>

<p>On the 8th Oct morning, it was time to remove the outer dressings/bandages
(still leaving the packing inside the vagina). A nurse from the clinic came and
removed the main dressing around 7 am, the process was not painful, just
uncomfortable. The drain I had that was plugged ti a vacuum pump and took
brownish liquid out was also removed, leaving a little hole. There were also
stitches directly from my body to the dressing removed. What was left was red
compress in the vestibule inside the labia minora (that are actually larger that
the labia minora because of swelling).</p>

<p>The morning, I felt intense pain. I never experienced that but I finally could
fall asleep until noon, with the pain. The doctor told me that they would give
me an injection at 1 pm if I was still in pain, but I felt fine.</p>

<p>But the evening, the pain returned, not as sharp, but very uncomfortable. I
asked painkillers tablets, and that was fine. We spent a lot of time with Elie
to talk about things, very lovely. When the pains returned, I tried to sleep. By
the way, my IV had stopped working, so they removed it during the night. I tried
several positions until settling on my tummy because my buttock was in pain like
it was deeply bruised. Two hours later, I woke up sweating in much pain. I asked
for painkillers and they has to re-insert the IV at 4 am to give me an
injection, then I slept on my back as usual.</p>

<p>What a night.</p>

<p>Today, I'm suppose to be able to be able to walk with some help.</p>

  <p>Hi,</p>

<p>It's 5 am in the morning, and I can't sleep and I'm in slight pain. I spent all
the afternoon of Monday sleeping 'cause the last days at the hospital weren't so
great. I was released from the Hospital at Monday noon.</p>

<p>Sunday, I hoped to have the internal packing inside my vagina removed, It was
uncomfortable to have especially considering that my bowels had started to fill
up again and the packing took extra space. I also didn't feel much like eating.
I was not in a so good mood.</p>

<p>The night before was really painful (from Friday to Saturday). I had some sharp
pain that scared my boyfriend to death. I was sleeping gently, then, few moments
before a nurse came to give me the pills to take before bedtime, I woke up in
intense pain. I cried my lungs out, gasping for my breath, and scared everybody.</p>

<p>First, I took the bedtime pills that contained paracetamol, then the nurse came
with the standard painkillers (two pills of paracetamol 500) and finally she
came back with a huge (said my boyfriend) syringe of equivalent to morphine. I
was then left panting for few minutes before things came back to normal. This is
not usual but it can happen, beware.</p>

<p>I then called my parents (think so) to talk things out. Elie was very frustrated
not to be able to help me in any possible way, but sometimes you have to deal
things by yourself, and knowing your love mate is around is enough. Just like a
woman giving birth.</p>

<p>The next day, I didn't eat much, or not at all depending of your point of view,
my stomach was not agreeing with all the medicine I had to take (five pills
after each meals, even the one I didn't took, and about four or five at bedtime,
plus all the painkillers).</p>

<p>The night from Sunday to Monday was difficult al well, I had pain in my bladder,
and didn't want to take the paracetamol because on my scrambled stomach. I
called my parents at 4 am in the morning (11 pm in France) to understand that I
haven't drunk enough water. Of course, my IV had been removed. So there was no
way for the body to drain all the toxins from the pills. From 5 am to 6:30 I
drunk 1.5 litter and I was released from the pain.</p>

<p>At 6:30 came the torture I was expecting, drink from 1 to 2 litters of water
with the catheter (<em>sonde urinaire pour les français</em>) blocked. So the pee
couldn't come out and I could train my bladder to grow, since it had shrunk.
This was a very difficult exercise I found very difficult to do given all the
water I drunk before. Then, at 8, the catheter was released and the pain
removed.</p>

<p>Then, came Dr Suporn, he removed the vaginal packing (10 or 20 meters of gauze
bandage roll) and he proceeded to the first dilation. That is having the medium
dilator inserted up to 7 inches for 30 minutes (starting when you arrive at full
depth). I have to do that twice a day for at least 6 months if not more. After a
year, the regime can be eased a little. This was a little bit uncomfortable
only, as the dilator is constantly pressing the end of the vagina, but not so
hard.</p>

<p>Then I slept.</p>

<p>My passport to be released from the hospital was to pee all right, so I had to
drink more and have a nurse confirm that I could pee. It doesn't spray in the
right direction still, because of the swelling, but I can pee ok.</p>

<p>All this time, I still felt nausea, and I effectively threw up few minutes
before leaving the hospital and just after a nurse gave me an injection of
anti-nausea. Ironic. Can't stand medication I tell you. By the way, even if I
didn't escape injection of painkillers before removing the packing, I escaped
the after-breakfast pills, so that was good. Only the smell of the pills made me
nauseous.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Hotel, I was greeted by
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/valerietr38/blog">Valerie</a> who seems to look fine, and I
then went to my room to sleep it off. Elie ordered room service, and I ate a
portion of a greek salad before a nurse from the clinic came to help me dilate a
second time by myself. I also escaped the pills this time. Then I slept again
and at wakeup I had a wonderful dream, and my nausea was almost gone. I ate
another greek salad without dressing for dinner and this time took my pills
(only the necessary, antibiotics and anti-swelling, I left the painkillers off).</p>

<p>I finally took the painkillers this night, the ones that are small.</p>

using the plastic strap you sat on</li>
<li>Wait 30 minutes</li>
<li>Remove the dilator slowly</li>
<li>Go wash the vaginal area in the shower, you need a syringe</li>
<li>Use 3 full syringes of drinking water and insert the water in the vaginal

<li>Use a syringe with 5 graduations (0.5 ml) of betadine and use drinking water
to fill the rest of the syringe (50 ml). Wash the vaginal opening the same
