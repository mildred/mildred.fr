<div class="body"><p>I always wanted to manage the files in my home directory. Generally, it's a
complete mess and I wanted to get things right and understand the files I had.</p>

<p>At first, I just created a simple shell script that maintained symbolic links of
the dotfiles and dordirs of my homedirs to <code>.local/config</code>, sort of early XDG
configuration directory. I also changed my .bashrc and later .zshrc to point to
files in <code>.local/etc/profile.d</code>. The shell script was reading a database in
<code>.local/config/database.sh</code> that contained the link information in the form.</p>

<p>The script did the following for each file declared:</p>

<ul>
<li>if the file existed in the homedir but not in the database directory, it was
simply moved and a link was created in its place.</li>
<li>if the file existed at both places, tell there is a conflict.</li>
<li>if the file existed in the database directory but not in the homedir, create
the link</li>
</ul>


<p>The database looks like:</p>

<pre><code>link ".bashrc" "bashrc"&#x000A;link ".zshrc"  "zshrc"&#x000A;&#x000A;# First file in home directory&#x000A;# Second file in .local/config&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>My script just defined a function <code>link</code> and sourced the database. But links
were not easy to construct in shell. So later, I decided to rewrite it in Tcl,
simply because the syntax is compatible (I love the Tcl syntax for that) and
because of the wonderful <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/file.htm">file</a> command.</p>

<p>Later, I improved the script that was then called <code>fixdir</code> to list which files
were not managed, and display them. So I could either delete those files
(because I don't care about them) or integrate them in the database. The script
gained a <code>clean</code> command to automatically remove files declared as noisy.</p>

<p>Now, I have a slightly different problem. I have now different computers which
do not have all the same configuration. At first, I synchronized everything and
just used the hostname in the database to get different links depending on the
machine. But now, with my computer at work, I will not synchronize all the
personal configurations. i have to get to a modular approach.</p>

<p>And this script did not help me in tracking what programs I installed in
<code>~/.local/{bin,share,lib}</code>. For this, I wanted something like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/index.html">stow</a>. I
tried using stow, but it failed with a conflict. Then I tried using
<a href="https://github.com/docwhat/homedir">homedir</a>. I just didn't like it because it created an ugly <code>~/bin</code>
instead of <code>~/.local/bin</code>.</p>

<p>Then I realized my <code>fixdir</code> script looks much like <code>homedir</code> already, and I
patched it up to make it better. And there it is.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mildred/fixdir">The current version of fixdir is on github.</a></p>

<p>Let me copy the README file:</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>This is my homedir package manager. Written first in shell then translated in
tcl. Originally, this was just to maintain a set of symbolic links from my home
directory to a directory where all important comfig files were stored. Then I
decided to make it a package manager.</p>

<h2>How to install it?</h2>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/mildred/fixdir.git fixdir&#x000A;fixdir_dir="$(pwd)/fixdir"&#x000A;cd&#x000A;"$fixdir_dir/fixdir" install "$fixdir_dir/hpkg.tcl"&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p><code>fixdir</code> is installed in <code>~/.local/bin</code>. Make sure it is in your <code>$PATH</code>.</p>

<h2>How does it work</h2>

<p><code>fixdir</code> works better when you are in your target directory (homedir)</p>

<p>Invoke one action with a database file. The database file is a tcl script that
contain all files and directories that should be linked.</p>

<h2>What else can it do?</h2>

<p><code>fixdir unknown</code> list all files not manages by fixdir in the current directory</p>

<p><code>fixdir clean</code> remove files declared as noisy</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li>fixdir list doesn't work when pwd != target directory</li>
