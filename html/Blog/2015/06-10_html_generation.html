Hello there, I'm here to talk about how I generate this website again. My
requirements where:

- To generate static pages. No server side running code except a basic static
HTTP server

- To keep away, as far as it is still possible, from javascript on the client
side. The idea here is to allow the website to be seen from a javascript
disabled browser.

- Use HTML as the native source format instead of Markdown. HTML is the true
format for the web. When making this site, I had to convert the source format
many times. This is unacceptable anymore.

- Use Markdown or similar formats for writing texts because HTML (XML) needs
escaping for simple characters and is not easy to type in a text editor.

- Use links (`<link rel="..."/>`) and backlinks (`<link rev="..."/>`) to make
relations between pages. This is the future of hyperlink on the web. I imagine a
world where these backlinks would be generated automatically and would be used
to dynamically generate article comments for examples.

- Allow templating. I want to have common header / footer / menu on all pages
(even though that is not strictly necessary, I'll have to talk about it at some
future time)

The solution implies extending HTML by creating new tags. This can either be
implemented server side, or client side (with the webcomponents). Because
I don't want to rely on the client having Javascript enabled, I chose to go for
server side. In the future, I could implement them client-side, and if it
becomes popular, they could be directly integrated in the browser. Allowing the
use of these tags on javascript disabled browsers.

For parsing simplicity, I also chose to use a XML syntax with self closing tags
like `<br/>` instead of `<br>`. I also plan to make use of XML namespaces as it
allow to avoid conflicts in new tags and attributes.

Basically, I have a directory with the sources files, and a destination
directory. Non HTML files are copied verbatim, while HTML files go through the
following pipeline:

    html-includetag | html-expandurl | html-template | html-markdown | html-expandurl

Each of these is a program I developped in Go that transforms the input HTML in
some way, generally by processing a tag.

The pipeline is run in the same directory as the source file because in many
cases, the scripts needs to access related resources. The source file location
is required, and this information is not passed on the pipeline.

`html-includetag`
-----------------

This is the first component I developped. It process includes, by copying the
included file content in place of the `<include-file/>` tag. This is important
for layouting for it allows to reuse markup. This is how the header and footer
is kept the same on all the pages here.

The simplest inclusion is:

    <include-file src="..."/>

which will put the content of the file in `...` in place of the tag. It will
also set the attribute `xml:base` on each root element included so the links of
the included file can still point to the correct target.

It is possible to embed content:

    <include-file src="...">
      ...
    </include-file>

The enclosed text will be kept and replaced where the included file has the
`<include-content/>` tag.
