<div class='body'><p>I started writing wwwgen: a website generator that uses redo for its
dependency tracking. Unfortunately, I might not have taken the correct
approach to the problem. I reuse the webgen concepts, and that might be
a bad idea.</p>

<p>Specifically, webgen (and my first version of wwwgen) are bottom-up
systems (you take the sources and build everything they can generate).
The problem is that redo itself is top-down (you take the target and
build it, building sources as they are needed), and I tried to make the
two match. It's very difficult, and impossible to do with a clean design.</p>

<p>What I'd like to have is a simple <code>wwwgen</code> binary that generates a HTML
file from a source file. Let's imagine how it could work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the source file is a simple page with no templates, just generate
the HTML and this is it</p></li>
<li><p>If the source file is a simple page with a template, redo-ifchange the
template source and build the HTML combining the two</p></li>
<li><p>If the source file is an index, we have a problem because multiple
outputs are generated. Redo doesn't support this case and we must find a
way to make it work.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So, we have a problem here ...</p>

<p>Now, we have another problem. Specifically, my source file is called
<code>title.page</code> and I want my output file to be <code>title/index.html</code>. In
webgen, this is implemented by a configuration in <code>title.page</code> telling
it to build in <code>title/index.html</code>.</p>

<p>There is a solution to solve both problems at once. the wwwgen command
creates an archive (the formats needs to be defined, it could be tar, or
different yaml documents in the same file for example). Then, the build
process would be:</p>

<p><strong>all.do</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> find src -name "*.src" \&#x000A;   | sed 's/src$/gen/' \&#x000A;   | xargs -d '\n' redo-ifchange&#x000A; find src -name "*.gen" \&#x000A;   | xargs -d '\n' wwwgen unpack&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p><strong>default.gen.do</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> redo-ifchange "$2.src"&#x000A; wwwgen --redo-dependencies -o "$3" generate "$2.src"&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p><code>wwwgen generate</code> would parse the source file and generate an archive,
that will be unpacked later by <code>wwwgen unpack</code>. Let's see how it can work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The source file can choose where it unpacks, relatively to the
directory where the source file is</p></li>
<li><p>If the source file is an index, it will redo-ifchange the other source
files for the index and redo-ifchange the template, generate multiple
pages packed together.</p></li>
<li><p>If the source file is a tag tree (a special source that doesn't output
anything on its own but create index files dynamically), then it parses
every child to find a canonical list of tags and the paths they refer
to. Then, it creates the index files. Unfortunately, those index files
will never be compiled until next build.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>How an we improve the design to be able to create source files dynamically.</p>

<p>There are different views to the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>pages, index and tags should all generate all the output files they
are related to. It means that index files should be able to generate
pages, and tags should be able to generate indexes and pages.</p></li>
<li><p>pages should generate the output file, index should generate pages and
feeds and tags should generate index.</p></li>
<li><p>mixed solution (the one described): pages generate output file, index
should generate the output files as well and tags generates index.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>How can we generate source files on the fly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>have a predefined compilation order: first tags, then index and lastly
feeds and pages.</p></li>
<li><p>rebuild everything until no more source files are generated. We might
build unnecessary things.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I prefer the second solution which is more flexible, but we need a way
to avoid building things twice. For example, it's not necessary to build
a page if on the next phase the page source is going to be regenerated.</p>

<p>Very simply, the generated page can contain a link to the index source
file that generated it, and when generating the page, <code>redo-ifchange</code> is
run on the index file.</p>

<p>Next question: what if a tag is deleted. The corresponding index page is
going to stay around until the next clean. The tag page should keep
around a list of index files it generated and delete them when a tag is
no longer detected. And deleting the index should not be done using <code>rm</code>
because the index will need to delete the pages it generated. The best
solution would be to integrate to redo to detect these files.</p>

<p>The build scripts now are:</p>

<p><strong>all.do</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> oldsrclist=&#x000A; srclist="$(find src -name "*.src")"&#x000A; while [ "$oldsrclist" != "$srclist" ]; do&#x000A;   echo "$srclist" \&#x000A;     | sed 's/src$/gen/' \&#x000A;     | xargs -d '\n' redo-ifchange&#x000A;   oldsrclist="$srclist"&#x000A;   srclist="$(find src -name "*.src")"&#x000A; done&#x000A;&#x000A; find src -name "*.gen" \&#x000A;   | xargs -d '\n' wwwgen unpack&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p><strong>default.gen.do</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> redo-ifchange "$2.src"&#x000A; wwwgen --redo-dependencies -o "$3" generate "$2.src"&#x000A;</code></pre></div>
