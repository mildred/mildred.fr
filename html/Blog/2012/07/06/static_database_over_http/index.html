<div class="body"><p>Websites should be static. Any dynamic thingy (scripting using php,
ruby, python and the like) should be limited to a set of features that
absolutely cannot be implemented otherwise. Most GET requests should
lead to a static resolution (there can be exceptions such as GET queries
of search engines for instance).</p>

<p>Respecting this principle is quite simple, just generate the static
pages when they are updated, and no not worry about them afterwards.
This is what I try to use for my website, and it works quite well.</p>

<p>Advantages of this technique :</p>

<ul>
<li>your data will always be readable in the future, even if you may not
write it any more</li>
<li>improved security: normal operations only involve static files. You
get to spend more time with update actions (POST and PUT) and design
them better.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, I had the idea to extend this to databases. Do you know about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchDB">CouchDB</a> ? It's a database which
has a web interface only. I very like its design but again, I'd like it
to use the same principle as above.</p>

<p>The idea of such a database came with the feature I developed for my
blog: the user comments. In this blog, the user comments are completely
managed with JavaScript. If you don't have JavaScript, you don't have
comments at all. How do that work ?</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>To get the comments for an article, the JavaScript will contact a simple
PHP application in another server (a free hosting service). This simple
application is able to store and get JSON data using REST requests. The
JavaScript will then use <code>XmlHttpRequest</code> to contact the server and give
it the canonical URL (<code>&lt;link rel=canonical&gt;</code>). The server will answer a
JSON object with the comments.</p>

<p>Storing a comments is done the same way, using a <code>POST</code> request instead
of a <code>GET</code> request.</p>

<h2>To a Database Server</h2>

<p>This is very simple yet powerful. Why not extend this design to:</p>

<ul>
<li>allow any kind of data, not just comments</li>
<li>allow simple <code>GET</code> requests to bypass any script and just fetch the
raw data</li>
</ul>


<p>We can imagine the data store to be publicly accessible using URL that
end up with the <code>.json</code> suffix. There would be a similar URL with
<code>.json.meta</code> to access the metadata about an object (its current
version, right access, ...). We can imagine the web applications of the
future being completely implemented on the client side. The server side
would be just a shared database.</p>

<p>We would obviously need a security layer to prevent anyone to read
anything if they should not be allowed. We can imagine three levels of
permissions:</p>

<ul>
<li>read and write by everyone</li>
<li>read by everyone, write only by authorized user</li>
<li>read and write only by authorized user</li>
</ul>


<p>We could imagine many different authentication mechanisms. For most
data, the mechanism could be of a shared secret. The metadata of a json
file would contain :</p>

<pre><code> "auth": "shared-secret",&#x000A; "secret": "path/to/another/file"&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>To get access to the file, the client would have to provide the exact
content of the file <code>"path/to/another/file"</code>, which would obviously be a
protected file, readable only by authorized access. It could be a
login/password or anything else.</p>

<p>Update operations would be :</p>

<ul>
<li><code>PUT</code>: to update the entire content of the file</li>
<li><code>POST</code>: append to the existing data (the data should be a JSON array)</li>
</ul>


<p>The data file will have an associated version which will be in the form
of "sha1:&lt;sha1 of the file&gt;". To successfully update a data file, the
existing version of the file must be given. If it is not the same, the
client should retry. This is the same concept as in CouchDB.</p></div>

          Scripts are disabled on your computer. In order to access existing
          comments and post new comments, you need to enable Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rationale: This server that hosts my website is a static server.
          In order to implement comments, a XmlHttpRequest is made on an API
          server to both retrieve the comments and post a new comment.
