      <div class="excerpt">
        <p>I just moved the site to <a href="https://github.com/mildred/webgen">webgen</a>. For the
        occasion, forked the project on github and improved a lot of things. As webgen
        doesn't seem to be alive, I think I'll be the one maintaining it in the future.</p>
        
        <p>I took the occasion to move my website over to my own web server, hosted at
        home. If I ever find it unsuitable, I can very easily host my website elsewhere
        as it is just a bunch of static pages.</p>
        
        <p>More to come ...</p>
      </div>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Webgen allows me to split a post in two, an excerpt and a content. Perhaps the
        name excerpt is ill chosen as currently it seems more like a teaser. Anyway.</p>
        
        <p>I already improved or added the following features in webgen:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>an index content handler type which job is to list other pages' content and
        provide pagination. It also create atom and rss feeds.</li>
        <li>a tag content handler that creates index pages, thus creating pagination and
        feeds for each and every tag.</li>
        <li>ability to include other pages' content directly from within haml or erb.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p>Next, I'll want to:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Have a cron job that updates the website automatically, or a git hook doing
        just that.</li>
        <li>Look at what I can do in terms of a gallery.</li>
        <li>Parse e-mails sent to a special mailbox to create blog post from them
        automatically</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p>All of this is released open source.</p>

        <p>
          Scripts are disabled on your computer. In order to access existing
          comments and post new comments, you need to enable Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rationale: This server that hosts my website is a static server.
          In order to implement comments, a XmlHttpRequest is made on an API
          server to both retrieve the comments and post a new comment.
