<div class='body'><h2>The overlooked problem</h2>

<p>Let me explain the reason why I think Lisaac is broken and why I stopped
working on it. The fundamental concept behind it is completely broken,
and i never could solve the problem. First, let me explain a few things
about Lisaac:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is statically typed (like Eiffel)</li>
<li>It is prototype based (like Self)</li>
</ul>


<p>It may not seem like it but those two things are mutually exclusive,
unless something is done to reconcile the two. Being statically typed
means you know the type (or a parent of the real type) at compile-time.
Being prototype based means that the type can change completely.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a <code>CUCUMBER</code> that inherit <code>VEGETABLE</code>. If at some point
during run-time, the cucumber inherit <code>SOFTWARE</code> (yes, cucumber is the
name of a software as well) you have a problem. Yet, this is not the
problem I want to talk about.</p>

<p>Lisaac solve this problem because you can only assign a child type as a
parent. In the following object:</p>

<pre><code> Section Header&#x000A;   + name := CUCUMBER;&#x000A; Section Inherit&#x000A;   + parent :VEGETABLE := ...;&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>So, you're forbidden to assign a <code>SOFTWARE</code> in the <code>parent</code> slot because
<code>SOFTWARE</code> is not a child of <code>VEGETABLE</code>. But, you're allowed to assign
a <code>GREEN_VEGETABLE</code>. So not it becomes:</p>

<pre><code> Section Header&#x000A;   + name := CUCUMBER;&#x000A; Section Inherit&#x000A;   + parent :VEGETABLE := GREEN_VEGETABLE;&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's say you send a message to your cucumber, and through the
magic of inheritance, you end up in a slot of the parent. That is, you
are executing code that is located in <code>GREEN_VEGETABLE</code>. Then, you have
a problem.</p>

<pre><code> Section Header&#x000A;   + name := GREEN_VEGETABLE;&#x000A; Section Public&#x000A;   // inherited from VEGETABLE&#x000A;   - do_something &lt;- paint_it_green;&#x000A; Section Private&#x000A;   // specific to GREEN_VEGETABLE&#x000A;   - paint_it_green &lt;- ( "green".println; );&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>In the code above, if you are executing the <code>do_something</code> slot and have
<code>SELF = CUCUMBER</code>, you can't possibly call the <code>paint_it_green</code> slot
because it does not exist in <code>CUCUMBER</code>, and the Lisaac compiler will
refuse to compile your code. To explain it another way, the type of
<code>Self</code> is not compatible with <code>GREEN_VEGETABLE</code>, and this is a problem
for this is the code we are executing. You can't easily solve this problem.</p>

<p>In the Self language, if you had a similar situation, it would work
because it is not statically typed. It would have failed to find
<code>paint_in_green</code> in the cucumber and called the parent, which would have
been a green vegetable. Somehow, the type of the cucumber would have
changed at runtime, which is incompatible with a type system that can
only compute types at compile time (and have them immutable at run time).</p>

<h2>So, I stopped working on Lisaac</h2>

<p>I tried to start up a new project, Lysaac, but got confronted to the
same problem once the compiler was mature enough to start getting into
inheritance. So I stopped again.
<a href="http://pesn.com/2012/09/02/9602175_Waking_Up_is_Hard_to_Do/">Life getting in the way</a> didn't help.</p>

<h2>A new hope</h2>

<p>I tried to look into virtual machines, convincing myself that compiled
languages couldn't possibly answer such need to dynamic things in the
language. I looked at Self for the first time. I tried to build a
virtual machine that was fully concurrent. I looked at the Go language
because I know that it has nice concurrent primitives ... and I found
illumination.</p>

<p>The Go language feels like a dynamic language, but it is compiled. I
always wondered how it could implement duck typing, and I <a href="http://research.swtch.com/interfaces">found
out</a>. I also realized that the difference between a virtual machine
with a JIT compiler, and a runtime for a compiled language that included
a compiler was very narrow. Basically, nothing prevents any language
from being compiled instead of being JIT compiled. You just have to
include a compiler in the standard library.</p>

<p>Ironically, that what Common Lisp is doing.</p>

<h2>A new language</h2>

<p>I like how Go implements interfaces, and I want to do the same. In this
new language, an object is composed of :</p>

<ul>
<li>an opaque work (pointer sized)</li>
<li>a pointer to an interface</li>
</ul>


<p>An interface is a collection of pointers to functions. There is always a
pointer for the fallback implementation and a pointer for the case
operation (to case an object to a new interface).</p>

<p>I want to use a smalltalk/Io type syntax. So the following will
represent an object with one variable and one slot:</p>

<pre><code> obj := {&#x000A;   var := obj slot;&#x000A;   slot &lt;- { ... };&#x000A; }&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>The data word of obj would be a pointer to a struct containing the
variable "var"
The interface of obj would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a function pointer for the fallback implementation that throws an error</li>
<li>a function pointer for the "cast" operation</li>
<li>a function pointer for the "slot" slot</li>
</ul>


<p>I haven't figured out yet how to pass parameters to functions and return
objects. This kind of things will require to comply to predefined
interfaces (we need a way to tell which object type is returned by a
slot for example). Interfaces would probably be defined at compile time
and available as constants in code at run time (to be given as parameter
to the cast slot).</p>

<p>If I want to be able to compile on the fly the code, I need to include
the LLVM library. So I need to implement the language in a language that
is compiled using LLVM (so bootstraping will be easier).</p></div>
