<div class="body"><p>What is a prototype? I often wondered what it exactly meant. And I am
developping a prototype-based language: Lisaac.</p>

<p>I went on Wikipedia to find out:</p>

<blockquote><p>Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which
classes are not present, and behavior reuse (known as inheritance in
class-based languages) is performed via a process of cloning existing objects
that serve as prototypes. This model can also be known as class-less,
prototype-oriented or instance-based programming. Delegation is the language
feature that supports prototype-based programming.</p></blockquote>

<p>To cut the story short:</p>

<ul>
<li>you don't have classes</li>
<li>instead you already have full featured objects (with values)</li>
<li>you don't instanciate, you clone the prototype</li>
</ul>


<p>And that's all. But often, prototype-based language have other very interesting
features.</p></div>

          Scripts are disabled on your computer. In order to access existing
          comments and post new comments, you need to enable Javascript.

          Rationale: This server that hosts my website is a static server.
          In order to implement comments, a XmlHttpRequest is made on an API
          server to both retrieve the comments and post a new comment.
