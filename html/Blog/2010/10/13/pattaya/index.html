        <p>Yesterday, everything went fine. I just finished dilation that took and hour and
        a half, taking my time. Elie went to a trip to Pattaya organized by the clinic,
        and I have all the day to myself.</p>
        
        <p>During dilation, I listened to Karunesh, relaxing music, and read a little but
        of the Hannah Montanna like story:
        <a href="http://bigclosetr.us/topshelf/book/16505/sarah-carerra">Sarah Carrera</a></p>
        
        <p>It was ok, I reached 7" without mich difficulty, but I had to take care to have
        everything reachable, including the mirror since I was alone. Just a nurse from
        the clinic came at the beginning to check things up and left me alone. Daily
        visit.</p>
        
        <p>With the mirror, you can't place it to near since you need place for the
        dilator, beware.</p>
        
        <p>I'm fine and in a good mood, I can start my day now.</p>
