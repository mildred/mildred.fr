        <p>I ordered fish and chips without fish ... A nice way to order french fries and
        salad. Because everyone is in Pattaya, I could discuss with other people, from
        UK actually and Australia. Everyone is very nice and it's good to know I will
        have people to talk to until the end.</p>
        
        <p>Dr Suporn stopped surgeries for some time to take vacations, well deserved. So
        he can spend time with his family. And as time passes, there is less and less
        people around. This also means the clinic staff has more time and appointments
        would often be earlier. That's why Aey came just when I started dilating this
        morning. I left the door open for her (and wrote a note).</p>

          comments and post new comments, you need to enable Javascript.

          Rationale: This server that hosts my website is a static server.
          In order to implement comments, a XmlHttpRequest is made on an API
          server to both retrieve the comments and post a new comment.
