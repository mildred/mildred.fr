        <p>The equivalent of morphine was <em>dynastat 40mg</em> (I don't know why 40mg since
        it is supposed to be injections, but perhaps if was 40mg in the syringe)</p>
        
        <p>Now, I take after each meals:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>antibiotics: I have 20 pills of <em>Ciprofloxacin 500mg</em></li>
        <li>swelling reducer: I have 30 pills of <em>dangen 5mg</em> (if I can read well)</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p>And Dr Suporn advised me to take medication to help bowel movements: <em>Prolax</em> at
        bed time. He told me that if I noticed bleeding, I should stop. I also just
        noticed that the instructions is to take two pills a day, and I took only one. I
        think I will stick to one pill as I don't have major problems.</p>
        
        <p>I also use hybiscrub soap, which is antiseptic surgical soap. I was advised not
        to use it too much as it might not be good for the skin. So only before and
        after dilation.</p>
        
        <p>I apply antiseptic cream inside the labia minora: Dermazin which says it is 1%
        Micronized Silver Sulfadiazine. It is also indicated for treatments of burns. I
        apply this every time I wash the vaginal area (usually with tap water, I was
        instructed not to try to clean too much).</p>
