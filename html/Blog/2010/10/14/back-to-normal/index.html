<div class="body"><p>So, I'm fine, well, in a good mood. The days follows and are similar. Dilation
is ok even though I must go in a deep relaxation state. I think I shouldn't try
to sleep these moments and instead try to meditate as much as possible (stay in
the presence)</p>

<p>My farther told me that it might be easier to find the nature of mind as I have
accomplished quite a lot of what I wanted and I enter a peaceful state of
accomplishment.</p>

<p>Good news as well, <strong>I'm lactating.</strong> I'm not joking but it happened. My
boyfriend sucked on my right breast and he felt a salty taste, and rightly, some
mild escape from my breasts after some stimulation. I couldn't possibly feed a
baby yet, but that's a start. It might be the lack of hormones (stopped one week
before the trip) or the medication. But Elie said he felt that taste even
before.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's fun to play with. I'll show you some photos.</p></div>
