What is a prototype? I often wondered what it exactly meant. And I am
developping a prototype-based language: Lisaac.

I went on Wikipedia to find out:

> Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which
> classes are not present, and behavior reuse (known as inheritance in
> class-based languages) is performed via a process of cloning existing objects 
> that serve as prototypes. This model can also be known as class-less, 
> prototype-oriented or instance-based programming. Delegation is the language 
> feature that supports prototype-based programming.

To cut the story short:

* you don't have classes
* instead you already have full featured objects (with values)
* you don't instanciate, you clone the prototype

And that's all. But often, prototype-based language have other very interesting
features.
