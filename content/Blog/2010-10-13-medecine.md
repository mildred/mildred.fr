The equivalent of morphine was *dynastat 40mg* (I don't know why 40mg since
it is supposed to be injections, but perhaps if was 40mg in the syringe)

Now, I take after each meals:

- antibiotics: I have 20 pills of *Ciprofloxacin 500mg*
- swelling reducer: I have 30 pills of *dangen 5mg* (if I can read well)

And Dr Suporn advised me to take medication to help bowel movements: *Prolax* at
bed time. He told me that if I noticed bleeding, I should stop. I also just
noticed that the instructions is to take two pills a day, and I took only one. I
think I will stick to one pill as I don't have major problems.

I also use hybiscrub soap, which is antiseptic surgical soap. I was advised not
to use it too much as it might not be good for the skin. So only before and
after dilation.

I apply antiseptic cream inside the labia minora: Dermazin which says it is 1%
Micronized Silver Sulfadiazine. It is also indicated for treatments of burns. I
apply this every time I wash the vaginal area (usually with tap water, I was
instructed not to try to clean too much).
