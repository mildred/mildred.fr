Yesterday, after noon when we ate at the Hotel's restaurant, we went to town to
go shop a little. Finally, we spent the entire afternoon in a mall where there
were many shops. We bought:

* two SIM cards for our mobile phones
* a buddha figurine
* clothes

The mall has four floors with many different shops, cinemas, ... I don't know
how I can tell about it, probably best if you come visit. Things aren't very
cheap, but still cheaper than in France. Elie says things costs half the price
in France.

To give you an idea, 40 baht (THB) is approximately 1 euro. The SIM card costs
from 50 baht to 99 baht, each call costs 2 baht for the first minute, and then,
0.5 baht per minute. The top we bought costs around 399 bahts, around 10 euros.
A typical dish at the Hotel's restaurant costs from 150 baht to 300 baht.

Anyway, when we left the mall, it was raining, and the sun was set. Back at the
hotel, I worked to buy the domain mildred.fr and a hosting service to host the
blog. I couldn't update the website on free.fr from Thailand, access denied. At
the same time, Elie went to buy a pizza with fried fries and fried onions rolls
(these taste very good by the way) that we ate in the room.

Today, we awoke at 9 am, still early from us who still suffer lightly from jet
lag, and went downstairs to have our first breakfast in the hotel. Yesterday, we
woke up at 11:30 am. Far too late. I also learned that I had to be available at
11 am to be admitted to the hospital. We just had time to eat, prepare, and
hurry to the lobby.

The hospital is very modern, we were admitted, and I had a plastic bracelet
attached around my arm, with my name on it. On the 9th floor (**room 902, I was
mistaken before**), we have the view on the sea. The room is big, clean, and I
would be tempted to add beautiful, but it's an hospital room after all.

We had to make our choice of meal for noon and afternoon on a menu, and I was
able to add that we were vegetarian, so the dishes don't contain any meat. We
ate, and I spent the afternoon putting photos on the blog, and doing other
things. The afternoon meal was at 5 pm and I just ordered a vegetable soup. I do
like it, more than the tomato soup that taste lake ketchup (that I distaste).

Just before 9 pm, I had to be prepared for the operation tomorrow. I had an
enema *(lavement en fran√ßais)*, not very nice to have if you ask me. And I had
to have my genitals shaved. That's where I am at now. I just followed that by a
shower, including shampoo that I won't have the opportunity to have until next
week.

I feel ok, I would have expected nervousness perhaps, but no. Now, it's 10:20 pm
and I am going to sleep soon. I was given a sleep pill if ever I would find hard
to go to sleep, but I don't think I'll use it.

I'm ready for tomorrow, the schedule is to be waken up from 6 am to 7 am, take a
shower using surgical soap, and go to the operation theater around 8:30 to 9 am.
Then, follows 5 hours of operation, 1 hour of waking up and I shall be around at
3 pm, and I'll perhaps call around noon for the people in Europe.

Good night :)

Shanti
