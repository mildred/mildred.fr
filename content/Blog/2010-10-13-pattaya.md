Yesterday, everything went fine. I just finished dilation that took and hour and
a half, taking my time. Elie went to a trip to Pattaya organized by the clinic,
and I have all the day to myself.

During dilation, I listened to Karunesh, relaxing music, and read a little but
of the Hannah Montanna like story:

It was ok, I reached 7" without mich difficulty, but I had to take care to have
everything reachable, including the mirror since I was alone. Just a nurse from
the clinic came at the beginning to check things up and left me alone. Daily
visit.

With the mirror, you can't place it to near since you need place for the
dilator, beware.

I'm fine and in a good mood, I can start my day now.
