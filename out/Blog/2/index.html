  <p>It's today, I was just waken up by a nurse. I have one hour and a bit more to
prepare. That means take a shower and use the surgical soap.</p>

<p>I'm ok, all find. Just slightly nervous. But that's a normal reaction for such a
big operation.</p>

<p>I should go now.</p>

  <p>I'm alive</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay but I was in no condition to post before. Even now,stuck on
my bed, it"s not easy. My operation went well, this Monday morning. When I woke
up in the recovery room, I had a mask to help me breathe, with a lot of cream
(like gloss) to make it stick better I suppose. Before the op., I was wheeled
into the operating theater. My boyfriend stayed with me until I entered the
theater. I was almost crying.</p>

<p>When I woke up, I felt fine and I must have kept asking when I will go to my
room. I don't remember being wheeled back. Arrived, I felt fine and phoned to
Elie, my boyfriend as he wasn't here. It was 2:45 pm He didn't expect that I
would wake up so soon. He came a little after. I also phoned my parents using
the freephonie SIP account. I was still under the effect of anesthesia, so I had
a very small voice.</p>

<p>Pain was ok, I didn't have much (but I was under morphine). This apparently
caused me redness so they later switched to something else. With time, i felt
less and less pain. Now, it's only pressure under the dressings, nothing more.
But they still give me paracetamol I think.</p>

<p>Next morning, the anesthetist came to confirm everything was all right. She
indeed switch from morphine and also had to inject me anti-inflammatory because
my blood was clotting a bit more than usual, but still in the normal range. She
also told me that at first she couldn't insert the breathing tube in my throat
because my throat was too thin, so she had to insert a smaller tube, 7.5 inner
diameter. That's probably why I have I fairer voice.</p>

<p>Later, Dr Suporn visited me, and quickly said that I could move, it was good for
blood circulation. Legs, torso, arms ... And stated again the no sexual taught
motto. Then, the day passed quickly with me eating, sleeping eating and sleeping
again, probably because of the sleep pills.</p>

<p>I'll leave you here, I have to go down to a more comfortable position.</p>

  <p>Continuing ... I'm not so sleepy anymore, but still in bed. Today, they removed
my IV and I should be able to walk. Anyway, let's start from the beginning.</p>

<p>After the operation, I was very pale, gray lips and the like. I remember the
oxygen mask I had at the time and the cream (like gloss I remember to think)
that came with it. Not much else. Back in the hospital room, I called my
boyfriend who taught I would still be asleep, he came soon after, greeting me.</p>

<p>I slept with Jib helping me during the night to move in bed, and with
everything. She was very considerate (like everyone at the clinic)</p>

<p>Next morning, the anesthetist ... well I already talked about that and I want to
say something else while I can write. I start to have pain already.</p>

<p>Days followed, I felt better and better, that's good. Sleep, order menu, eat
food I don't want to eat ('cause I don't want to eat anything even if hungry).
Cold french fried passed rather well for they taste close to nothing. I like
fruits as well. For us vegetarians, the menu is rather limited.</p>

<p>On the last night I slept with the dressings, that is the night of 7-8 Oct, I
started to feel pain, but surprisingly on my right ankle on the right side.
Brief and sharp. I was told I didn't exercise much but I also heard such
descriptions of pain related to nerves regrowing. But I didn't have surgery on
my ankle.</p>

<p>I also had a terrible nightmare (I never had in years) where I left my hospital
bed, still with bandages, chasing something. And I was trying to get back to bed
before the nurses could tell me off. I woke up shivering, and sweating. So much
so I asked the nurse to give me painkillers injections (some equivalent to
morphine). I has another shot in the morning.</p>

<p>On the 8th Oct morning, it was time to remove the outer dressings/bandages
(still leaving the packing inside the vagina). A nurse from the clinic came and
removed the main dressing around 7 am, the process was not painful, just
uncomfortable. The drain I had that was plugged ti a vacuum pump and took
brownish liquid out was also removed, leaving a little hole. There were also
stitches directly from my body to the dressing removed. What was left was red
compress in the vestibule inside the labia minora (that are actually larger that
the labia minora because of swelling).</p>

<p>The morning, I felt intense pain. I never experienced that but I finally could
fall asleep until noon, with the pain. The doctor told me that they would give
me an injection at 1 pm if I was still in pain, but I felt fine.</p>

<p>But the evening, the pain returned, not as sharp, but very uncomfortable. I
asked painkillers tablets, and that was fine. We spent a lot of time with Elie
to talk about things, very lovely. When the pains returned, I tried to sleep. By
the way, my IV had stopped working, so they removed it during the night. I tried
several positions until settling on my tummy because my buttock was in pain like
it was deeply bruised. Two hours later, I woke up sweating in much pain. I asked
for painkillers and they has to re-insert the IV at 4 am to give me an
injection, then I slept on my back as usual.</p>

<p>What a night.</p>

<p>Today, I'm suppose to be able to be able to walk with some help.</p>

  <p>Hi,</p>

<p>It's 5 am in the morning, and I can't sleep and I'm in slight pain. I spent all
the afternoon of Monday sleeping 'cause the last days at the hospital weren't so
great. I was released from the Hospital at Monday noon.</p>

<p>Sunday, I hoped to have the internal packing inside my vagina removed, It was
uncomfortable to have especially considering that my bowels had started to fill
up again and the packing took extra space. I also didn't feel much like eating.
I was not in a so good mood.</p>

<p>The night before was really painful (from Friday to Saturday). I had some sharp
pain that scared my boyfriend to death. I was sleeping gently, then, few moments
before a nurse came to give me the pills to take before bedtime, I woke up in
intense pain. I cried my lungs out, gasping for my breath, and scared everybody.</p>

<p>First, I took the bedtime pills that contained paracetamol, then the nurse came
with the standard painkillers (two pills of paracetamol 500) and finally she
came back with a huge (said my boyfriend) syringe of equivalent to morphine. I
was then left panting for few minutes before things came back to normal. This is
not usual but it can happen, beware.</p>

<p>I then called my parents (think so) to talk things out. Elie was very frustrated
not to be able to help me in any possible way, but sometimes you have to deal
things by yourself, and knowing your love mate is around is enough. Just like a
woman giving birth.</p>

<p>The next day, I didn't eat much, or not at all depending of your point of view,
my stomach was not agreeing with all the medicine I had to take (five pills
after each meals, even the one I didn't took, and about four or five at bedtime,
plus all the painkillers).</p>

<p>The night from Sunday to Monday was difficult al well, I had pain in my bladder,
and didn't want to take the paracetamol because on my scrambled stomach. I
called my parents at 4 am in the morning (11 pm in France) to understand that I
haven't drunk enough water. Of course, my IV had been removed. So there was no
way for the body to drain all the toxins from the pills. From 5 am to 6:30 I
drunk 1.5 litter and I was released from the pain.</p>

<p>At 6:30 came the torture I was expecting, drink from 1 to 2 litters of water
with the catheter (<em>sonde urinaire pour les français</em>) blocked. So the pee
couldn't come out and I could train my bladder to grow, since it had shrunk.
This was a very difficult exercise I found very difficult to do given all the
water I drunk before. Then, at 8, the catheter was released and the pain
removed.</p>

<p>Then, came Dr Suporn, he removed the vaginal packing (10 or 20 meters of gauze
bandage roll) and he proceeded to the first dilation. That is having the medium
dilator inserted up to 7 inches for 30 minutes (starting when you arrive at full
depth). I have to do that twice a day for at least 6 months if not more. After a
year, the regime can be eased a little. This was a little bit uncomfortable
only, as the dilator is constantly pressing the end of the vagina, but not so
hard.</p>

<p>Then I slept.</p>

<p>My passport to be released from the hospital was to pee all right, so I had to
drink more and have a nurse confirm that I could pee. It doesn't spray in the
right direction still, because of the swelling, but I can pee ok.</p>

<p>All this time, I still felt nausea, and I effectively threw up few minutes
before leaving the hospital and just after a nurse gave me an injection of
anti-nausea. Ironic. Can't stand medication I tell you. By the way, even if I
didn't escape injection of painkillers before removing the packing, I escaped
the after-breakfast pills, so that was good. Only the smell of the pills made me
nauseous.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Hotel, I was greeted by
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/valerietr38/blog">Valerie</a> who seems to look fine, and I
then went to my room to sleep it off. Elie ordered room service, and I ate a
portion of a greek salad before a nurse from the clinic came to help me dilate a
second time by myself. I also escaped the pills this time. Then I slept again
and at wakeup I had a wonderful dream, and my nausea was almost gone. I ate
another greek salad without dressing for dinner and this time took my pills
(only the necessary, antibiotics and anti-swelling, I left the painkillers off).</p>

<p>I finally took the painkillers this night, the ones that are small.</p>

  <p>On the bathroom, you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hybiscrub soap</li>
<li>Betadine</li>
<li>Drinking water</li>
<li>Syrnge</li>
</ul>


<p>On the bedroom, you need at hand disposition (on the bed itself):</p>

<ul>
<li>Dilator</li>
<li>Condoms</li>
<li>KY Jelly</li>
<li>Mirror</li>
<li>Timer</li>
<li>Bed protection, plastic strap</li>
<li>Somthing to relax you during 30 minutes</li>
<li>Cotton balls and betadine (dressing kit)</li>
<li>Dermazine cream</li>
<li>Trash can</li>
<li>Basic cleaning material (paper)</li>
<li>Glasses</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Blanket if you might be cold (not in Thailand)</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, here is how to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shower and use hibiscrub soap on the vaginal area</li>
<li>Prepare the bed with the plastic and hygenic bed protection</li>
<li>Put the plastic strap so that you would sit on it</li>
<li>Lie down on the bed, knees down, relaxed</li>
<li>Put a condom on the medium dilator</li>
<li>Put a lot of KY jelly on the dilator and some on the vaginal opening</li>
<li>Insert the dilator slowly, the head directed down (don't go into the
urethra)</li>
<li>Push until 7 inches, you should feel pressure. You can keep the dilator in
using the plastic strap you sat on</li>
<li>Wait 30 minutes</li>
<li>Remove the dilator slowly</li>
<li>Go wash the vaginal area in the shower, you need a syringe</li>
<li>Use 3 full syringes of drinking water and insert the water in the vaginal
opening. Don't try to get the water on the end on the vagina, just wash the
opening.</li>
<li>Use a syringe with 5 graduations (0.5 ml) of betadine and use drinking water
to fill the rest of the syringe (50 ml). Wash the vaginal opening the same
way.</li>
<li>Use hybiscrub soap to gently wash the vaginal area.</li>
<li>Back on the bed, apply betadine on the scar lines with a cotton ball (in the
dressing kit)</li>
<li>Apply Dermazine antiseptic cream on the clitoris and inside the labia minora</li>
</ol>


<p>And you're set, do that twice a day.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday, everything went fine. I just finished dilation that took and hour and
                        a half, taking my time. Elie went to a trip to Pattaya organized by the clinic,
                        and I have all the day to myself.</p>
                        
                        <p>During dilation, I listened to Karunesh, relaxing music, and read a little but
                        of the Hannah Montanna like story:
                        <a href="http://bigclosetr.us/topshelf/book/16505/sarah-carerra">Sarah Carrera</a></p>
                        
                        <p>It was ok, I reached 7" without mich difficulty, but I had to take care to have
                        everything reachable, including the mirror since I was alone. Just a nurse from
                        the clinic came at the beginning to check things up and left me alone. Daily
                        visit.</p>
                        
                        <p>With the mirror, you can't place it to near since you need place for the
                        dilator, beware.</p>
                        
                        <p>I'm fine and in a good mood, I can start my day now.</p>

                        <p>The equivalent of morphine was <em>dynastat 40mg</em> (I don't know why 40mg since
                        it is supposed to be injections, but perhaps if was 40mg in the syringe)</p>
                        
                        <p>Now, I take after each meals:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                        <li>antibiotics: I have 20 pills of <em>Ciprofloxacin 500mg</em></li>

                        <p>And Dr Suporn advised me to take medication to help bowel movements: <em>Prolax</em> at
                        bed time. He told me that if I noticed bleeding, I should stop. I also just
                        noticed that the instructions is to take two pills a day, and I took only one. I
                        think I will stick to one pill as I don't have major problems.</p>
                        
                        <p>I also use hybiscrub soap, which is antiseptic surgical soap. I was advised not
                        to use it too much as it might not be good for the skin. So only before and
                        after dilation.</p>
                        
                        <p>I apply antiseptic cream inside the labia minora: Dermazin which says it is 1%
                        Micronized Silver Sulfadiazine. It is also indicated for treatments of burns. I
                        apply this every time I wash the vaginal area (usually with tap water, I was
                        instructed not to try to clean too much).</p>

                        <p>I ordered fish and chips without fish ... A nice way to order french fries and
                        salad. Because everyone is in Pattaya, I could discuss with other people, from
                        UK actually and Australia. Everyone is very nice and it's good to know I will
                        have people to talk to until the end.</p>
                        
                        <p>Dr Suporn stopped surgeries for some time to take vacations, well deserved. So
                        he can spend time with his family. And as time passes, there is less and less
                        people around. This also means the clinic staff has more time and appointments
                        would often be earlier. That's why Aey came just when I started dilating this
                        morning. I left the door open for her (and wrote a note).</p>
