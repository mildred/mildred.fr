<div class="excerpt">
  <h2>The overlooked problem</h2>

<p>Let me explain the reason why I think Lisaac is broken and why I stopped
working on it. The fundamental concept behind it is completely broken,
and i never could solve the problem. First, let me explain a few things
about Lisaac:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is statically typed (like Eiffel)</li>
<li>It is prototype based (like Self)</li>
</ul>


<p>It may not seem like it but those two things are mutually exclusive,
unless something is done to reconcile the two. Being statically typed
means you know the type (or a parent of the real type) at compile-time.
Being prototype based means that the type can change completely.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a <code>CUCUMBER</code> that inherit <code>VEGETABLE</code>. If at some point
during run-time, the cucumber inherit <code>SOFTWARE</code> (yes, cucumber is the
name of a software as well) you have a problem. Yet, this is not the
problem I want to talk about.</p>

<p>Lisaac solve this problem because you can only assign a child type as a
parent. In the following object:</p>

<pre><code> Section Header&#x000A;   + name := CUCUMBER;&#x000A; Section Inherit&#x000A;   + parent :VEGETABLE := ...;&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>So, you're forbidden to assign a <code>SOFTWARE</code> in the <code>parent</code> slot because
<code>SOFTWARE</code> is not a child of <code>VEGETABLE</code>. But, you're allowed to assign
a <code>GREEN_VEGETABLE</code>. So not it becomes:</p>

<pre><code> Section Header&#x000A;   + name := CUCUMBER;&#x000A; Section Inherit&#x000A;   + parent :VEGETABLE := GREEN_VEGETABLE;&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's say you send a message to your cucumber, and through the
magic of inheritance, you end up in a slot of the parent. That is, you
are executing code that is located in <code>GREEN_VEGETABLE</code>. Then, you have
a problem.</p>

<pre><code> Section Header&#x000A;   + name := GREEN_VEGETABLE;&#x000A; Section Public&#x000A;   // inherited from VEGETABLE&#x000A;   - do_something &lt;- paint_it_green;&#x000A; Section Private&#x000A;   // specific to GREEN_VEGETABLE&#x000A;   - paint_it_green &lt;- ( "green".println; );&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>In the code above, if you are executing the <code>do_something</code> slot and have
<code>SELF = CUCUMBER</code>, you can't possibly call the <code>paint_it_green</code> slot
because it does not exist in <code>CUCUMBER</code>, and the Lisaac compiler will
refuse to compile your code. To explain it another way, the type of
<code>Self</code> is not compatible with <code>GREEN_VEGETABLE</code>, and this is a problem
for this is the code we are executing. You can't easily solve this problem.</p>

<p>In the Self language, if you had a similar situation, it would work
because it is not statically typed. It would have failed to find
<code>paint_in_green</code> in the cucumber and called the parent, which would have
been a green vegetable. Somehow, the type of the cucumber would have
changed at runtime, which is incompatible with a type system that can
only compute types at compile time (and have them immutable at run time).</p>

<h2>So, I stopped working on Lisaac</h2>

<p>I tried to start up a new project, Lysaac, but got confronted to the
same problem once the compiler was mature enough to start getting into
inheritance. So I stopped again.
<a href="http://pesn.com/2012/09/02/9602175_Waking_Up_is_Hard_to_Do/index.html">Life getting in the way</a> didn't help.</p>

<h2>A new hope</h2>

<p>I tried to look into virtual machines, convincing myself that compiled
languages couldn't possibly answer such need to dynamic things in the
language. I looked at Self for the first time. I tried to build a
virtual machine that was fully concurrent. I looked at the Go language
because I know that it has nice concurrent primitives ... and I found
illumination.</p>

<p>The Go language feels like a dynamic language, but it is compiled. I
always wondered how it could implement duck typing, and I <a href="http://research.swtch.com/interfaces">found
out</a>. I also realized that the difference between a virtual machine
with a JIT compiler, and a runtime for a compiled language that included
a compiler was very narrow. Basically, nothing prevents any language
from being compiled instead of being JIT compiled. You just have to
include a compiler in the standard library.</p>

<p>Ironically, that what Common Lisp is doing.</p>

<h2>A new language</h2>

<p>I like how Go implements interfaces, and I want to do the same. In this
new language, an object is composed of :</p>

<ul>
<li>an opaque work (pointer sized)</li>
<li>a pointer to an interface</li>
</ul>


<p>An interface is a collection of pointers to functions. There is always a
pointer for the fallback implementation and a pointer for the case
operation (to case an object to a new interface).</p>

<p>I want to use a smalltalk/Io type syntax. So the following will
represent an object with one variable and one slot:</p>

<pre><code> obj := {&#x000A;   var := obj slot;&#x000A;   slot &lt;- { ... };&#x000A; }&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>The data word of obj would be a pointer to a struct containing the
variable "var"
The interface of obj would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a function pointer for the fallback implementation that throws an error</li>
<li>a function pointer for the "cast" operation</li>
<li>a function pointer for the "slot" slot</li>
</ul>


<p>I haven't figured out yet how to pass parameters to functions and return
objects. This kind of things will require to comply to predefined
interfaces (we need a way to tell which object type is returned by a
slot for example). Interfaces would probably be defined at compile time
and available as constants in code at run time (to be given as parameter
to the cast slot).</p>

<p>If I want to be able to compile on the fly the code, I need to include
the LLVM library. So I need to implement the language in a language that
is compiled using LLVM (so bootstraping will be easier).</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <p>I started writing wwwgen: a website generator that uses redo for its
dependency tracking. Unfortunately, I might not have taken the correct
approach to the problem. I reuse the webgen concepts, and that might be
a bad idea.</p>

<p>Specifically, webgen (and my first version of wwwgen) are bottom-up
systems (you take the sources and build everything they can generate).
The problem is that redo itself is top-down (you take the target and
build it, building sources as they are needed), and I tried to make the
two match. It's very difficult, and impossible to do with a clean design.</p>

<p>What I'd like to have is a simple <code>wwwgen</code> binary that generates a HTML
file from a source file. Let's imagine how it could work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the source file is a simple page with no templates, just generate
the HTML and this is it</p></li>
<li><p>If the source file is a simple page with a template, redo-ifchange the
template source and build the HTML combining the two</p></li>
<li><p>If the source file is an index, we have a problem because multiple
outputs are generated. Redo doesn't support this case and we must find a
way to make it work.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So, we have a problem here ...</p>

<p>Now, we have another problem. Specifically, my source file is called
<code>title.page</code> and I want my output file to be <code>title/index.html</code>. In
webgen, this is implemented by a configuration in <code>title.page</code> telling
it to build in <code>title/index.html</code>.</p>

<p>There is a solution to solve both problems at once. the wwwgen command
creates an archive (the formats needs to be defined, it could be tar, or
different yaml documents in the same file for example). Then, the build
process would be:</p>

<p><strong>all.do</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> find src -name "*.src" \&#x000A;   | sed 's/src$/gen/' \&#x000A;   | xargs -d '\n' redo-ifchange&#x000A; find src -name "*.gen" \&#x000A;   | xargs -d '\n' wwwgen unpack&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p><strong>default.gen.do</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> redo-ifchange "$2.src"&#x000A; wwwgen --redo-dependencies -o "$3" generate "$2.src"&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p><code>wwwgen generate</code> would parse the source file and generate an archive,
that will be unpacked later by <code>wwwgen unpack</code>. Let's see how it can work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The source file can choose where it unpacks, relatively to the
directory where the source file is</p></li>
<li><p>If the source file is an index, it will redo-ifchange the other source
files for the index and redo-ifchange the template, generate multiple
pages packed together.</p></li>
<li><p>If the source file is a tag tree (a special source that doesn't output
anything on its own but create index files dynamically), then it parses
every child to find a canonical list of tags and the paths they refer
to. Then, it creates the index files. Unfortunately, those index files
will never be compiled until next build.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>How an we improve the design to be able to create source files dynamically.</p>

<p>There are different views to the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>pages, index and tags should all generate all the output files they
are related to. It means that index files should be able to generate
pages, and tags should be able to generate indexes and pages.</p></li>
<li><p>pages should generate the output file, index should generate pages and
feeds and tags should generate index.</p></li>
<li><p>mixed solution (the one described): pages generate output file, index
should generate the output files as well and tags generates index.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>How can we generate source files on the fly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>have a predefined compilation order: first tags, then index and lastly
feeds and pages.</p></li>
<li><p>rebuild everything until no more source files are generated. We might
build unnecessary things.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I prefer the second solution which is more flexible, but we need a way
to avoid building things twice. For example, it's not necessary to build
a page if on the next phase the page source is going to be regenerated.</p>

<p>Very simply, the generated page can contain a link to the index source
file that generated it, and when generating the page, <code>redo-ifchange</code> is
run on the index file.</p>

<p>Next question: what if a tag is deleted. The corresponding index page is
going to stay around until the next clean. The tag page should keep
around a list of index files it generated and delete them when a tag is
no longer detected. And deleting the index should not be done using <code>rm</code>
because the index will need to delete the pages it generated. The best
solution would be to integrate to redo to detect these files.</p>

<p>The build scripts now are:</p>

<p><strong>all.do</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> oldsrclist=&#x000A; srclist="$(find src -name "*.src")"&#x000A; while [ "$oldsrclist" != "$srclist" ]; do&#x000A;   echo "$srclist" \&#x000A;     | sed 's/src$/gen/' \&#x000A;     | xargs -d '\n' redo-ifchange&#x000A;   oldsrclist="$srclist"&#x000A;   srclist="$(find src -name "*.src")"&#x000A; done&#x000A;&#x000A; find src -name "*.gen" \&#x000A;   | xargs -d '\n' wwwgen unpack&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p><strong>default.gen.do</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> redo-ifchange "$2.src"&#x000A; wwwgen --redo-dependencies -o "$3" generate "$2.src"&#x000A;</code></pre>

<div class="excerpt">
  <p>I was looking at Git, and which features may land in the next few
releases, and I found the following things:</p>

<h2>Git-SVN will be completely redesigned</h2>

<p>If you worked with git-svn, you probably know that the git-svn workflow
has nothing to do with git. Basically, you just have the svn history and
have to use git-svn to push the changes back to the subversion
repository. You can't use git-push and that's really annoying.</p>

<p>Recently, the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote-helpers.html">git-remote-helpers</a> feature was
added. It allows git to interact with any kind of remote url, using a
specific <code>git-remote-*</code> command. For example, you can already use
mercurial this way (according to <a href="https://github.com/rfk/git-remote-hg">git-remote-hg</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>Git allows pluggable remote repository protocols via helper scripts. If you have a script named "git-remote-XXX" then git will use it to interact with remote repositories whose URLs are of the form XXX::some-url-here. So you can imagine what a script named git-remote-hg will do.</p>

<p>Yes, this script provides a remote repository implementation that communicates with mercurial. Install it and you can do:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone hg::https://hg.example.com/some-mercurial-repo&#x000A;$ cd some-mercurial-repo&#x000A;$ # hackety hackety hack&#x000A;$ git commit -a&#x000A;$ git push&#x000A;</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>The plan is to do the same with subversion. You could just do:</p>

<pre><code> $ git clone svn::http://svn.host.org/repo/trunk/&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>Branches might be tricky to implement, they might not be there. But you
will get what's already in git-svn but with a way better UI. And far
more possibilities for the future.</p>

<p>Here is the summary from the <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/SoC2011Projects#Remote_helper_for_Subversion_and_git-svn">GSoc</a> page:</p>

<blockquote><p>The submodule system of git is very powerful, yet not that easy to work with. This proposed work will strengthen the submodule system even more and improve the user experience when working with submodules.</p>

<p>Git repository: https://github.com/iveqy/git</p>

<p>Midterm evaluation: passed</p>

<p>Progress report / status:</p>

<ul>
<li>[GSoC 11] submodule improvements at git mailing list</li>
<li>[GSoC 11 submodule] Status update at git mailing list</li>
<li>[RFC PATCH] Move git-dir for submodules at git mailing list</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Submodules will be improved a lot</h2>

<p>I wish it was already there. From the <a href="https://github.com/jlehmann/git-submod-enhancements/wiki/index.html">wiki page</a>, the
improvements will be:</p>

<blockquote><p>As Dscho put it, submodules are the “neglected ugly duckling” of git. Time to change that …</p>

<p>Issues still to be tackled in this repo:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let am, bisect, checkout, checkout-index, cherry-pick, merge, pull, read-tree, rebase, reset &amp; stash work recursively on submodules (in progress)</li>
<li>Teach grep the --recursive option</li>
<li>Add means to specify which submodules shall be populated on clone</li>
<li>Showing that a submodule has a HEAD not on any branch in “git status”</li>
<li>gitk: Add popup menu for submodules to see the detailed history of changes</li>
<li>Teach “git prune” the “--recurse-submodules” option (and maybe honour the same default and options “git fetch” uses)</li>
<li>Better support for displaying merge conflicts of submodules</li>
<li>git gui: Add submodule menu for adding and fetching submodules</li>
<li>git status should call “git diff --submodule --ignore-submodules=dirty” instead of “git submodule summary” for providing a submodule summary when configured to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Add an “always-tip” mode</strong></li>
<li>Other commands that could benefit from a “--recurse-submodules” option: archive, branch, clean, commit, revert, tag.</li>
<li>In the long run git-submodule.sh should be converted to a rather simple wrapper script around core git functionality as more and more of that is implemented in the git core.</li>
</ul>


<p>Submodule related bugs to fix</p>

<ul>
<li>Cherry picking across submodule creation fails even if the cherry pick doesn’t touch any file in the submodules path</li>
<li>git submodule add doesn’t record the url in .git/config when the submodule path doesn’t exist.</li>
<li>git rebase --continue won’t work if the commit only contains submodule changes.</li>
</ul>


<p>Issues already solved and merged into Junio’s Repo:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since git 1.6.6:

<pre><code>New --submodule option to “git diff” (many thanks to Dscho for writing the core part!)&#x000A;Display of submodule summaries instead of plain hashes in git gui and gitk&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
<li>Since git 1.7.0:

<pre><code>“git status” and “git diff*” show submodules with untracked or modified files in their work tree as “dirty”&#x000A;git gui: New popup menu for submodule diffs&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
<li>Since git 1.7.1:

<pre><code>Show the reason why working directories of submodules are dirty (untracked content and/or modified content) in superproject&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
<li>Since git 1.7.2:

<pre><code>Add parameters to the “--ignore-submodules” option for “git diff” and “git status” to control when a submodule is considered dirty&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
<li>Since git 1.7.3:

<pre><code>Add the “ignore” config option for the default behaviour of “git diff” and “git status”. Both .git/config and .gitmodules are parsed for this option, the value set in .git/config. will override that from .gitmodules&#x000A;Add a global config option to control when a submodule is considered dirty (written by Dscho)&#x000A;Better support for merging of submodules (thanks to Heiko Voigt for writing that)&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
<li>Since git 1.7.4:

<pre><code>Recursive fetching of submodules can be enabled via command line option or configuration.&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
<li>Since git 1.7.5:

<pre><code>fetch runs recursively on submodules by default when new commits have been recorded for them in the superproject&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
<li>Since git 1.7.7:

<pre><code>git push learned the --recurse-submodules=check option which errors out when trying to push a superproject commit where the submodule changes are not pushed (part of Frederik Gustafsson’s 2011 GSoC project)&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
<li>Since git 1.7.8:

<pre><code>The “update” option learned the value “none” which disables “submodule init” and “submodule update”&#x000A;The git directory of a newly cloned submodule is stored in the .git directory of the superproject, the submodules work tree contains only a gitfile. This is the first step towards recursive checkout, as it enables us to remove a submodule directory (part of Frederik Gustafsson’s 2011 GSoC project)&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>And the <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/SoC2011Projects#Git_submodule_improvements">GSoC page</a>:</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <p>What is this all about: web privacy. We are tracked everywhere, and i'd like to
help if possible. So, let's design a web browser that for once respects your
privacy.</p>

<p>Main features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each website has its own cookie jar, its own cache and its own HTML5 local
storage</li>
<li>History related css attributes are disabled</li>
<li>External plugins are only enabled on demand</li>
<li>Support for Tor/I2P is enabled by default</li>
<li>You have complete control over who receives what information</li>
<li>Let's you control in the settings if you want to allow referrers or not.</li>
<li>The contextual menu let's you open links anonymously (no referrer, anonymous
session)</li>
</ul>


<p>The browser is bundled with a particular UI that let you control everything
during your browsing session. it is non intrusive and makes the best choice by
default. I am thinking of a notification bar that shows at the bottom. I noticed
that this place is not intrusive when I realized that the search bar in Firefox
was most of the time open, even if most of the time I didn't use it.</p>

<p>First, let's define a session:</p>

<ul>
<li>A session can be used my more than one domain at the same time.</li>
<li>A session is associated to a specific cache storage</li>
<li>A session is associated to a specific HTML5 storage</li>
<li>A session is associated to a specific cookie jar</li>
<li>A session acn be closed. When it is closed, session cookies are deleted from
the session</li>
<li>A session can be reopened. All long lasting cookies, cache, HTML5 storage
and such is then used again.</li>
<li>A session can be anonymous. In such a case, the session is deleted
completely when it is closed.</li>
<li>A session is associated to none, one or more domains. These domains are the
domains the end user can see in the address bar, not the sub items in the
page.</li>
</ul>


<p>Sessions are like Firefox profiles. If you iopen a new session, it's like you
opened a new Firefox profile you just created. Because people will never create
a different Firefox profile for each site.</p>

<p>If we want to protect privacy, when a link is opened, a new session should be
created each time. To make it usable to browse web sites, it is made possible to
share sessions in specific cases. Let's define the cases where it might be
intelligent to share a profile:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You click a link or submit a form and expect to still be logged-in in the
site you are viewing. You don't care if you follow a link to an external
page.</p>

<p>User Interface: If the link matches one of the domains of the session, then
keep the session. No UI. If the user wanted a new session, the "Open
anonymously" entry in the context menu exists. A button on the toolbar might
be available to enter a state where we always want to open links
anonymously.</p>

<p>If the link points to another domain, then open the link in a new session
unless "Open in the same session" was specified in the context menu. The UI
contains:</p>

<pre><code>We Protected your privacy by separating &lt;domain of the new site&gt; from&#x000A;the site you were visiting previously (&lt;domain of the previous site&gt;).&#x000A;&#x000A;Choices: [ (1) Create a new anonymous session          | ▼ ]&#x000A;         | (2) Continue session from &lt;previous domain&gt; |&#x000A;         | (3) Use a previous session for &lt;new domain&gt; |&#x000A;         | (4) Use session from bookmark "&lt;name&gt;"      |&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>The first choice is considered the default and the page is loaded with it.
If the user chooses a new option, then the page is reloaded.</p>

<p>If the user chooses (2), the page is reloaded with the previous session and
the user will be asked if "Do you want &lt;old domain&gt; and &lt;new domain&gt; to have
access to the same private information about you?". Answers are Yes, No and
Always. If the answer is Always, then in the configuration, the two domains
are considered one and the same.</p>

<p>The choice (3) will use the most recent session for the new domain. It might
be a session currently in use or a session in the history.</p>

<p>There are as many (4) options as there are bookmarks for the new domain. If
different bookmarks share a single session, only one bookmark is shown. This
choice will load the session from the bookmark.</p>

<p>If (3) and (4) are the same sessions, and there is only one bookmark (4),
then the (4) option is left out.</p></li>
<li><p>You use a bookmark and expect to continue the session you had for this
bookmark (webmails)</p>

<p>The session is simpely stored in the bookmark. When saving a bookmark, there
is an option to store the session with it or not.</p>

<pre><code>[X] Do not save any personal information with this bookmark&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You open a new URL and you might want reuse a session that was opened for
this URL.</p>

<p>The User Interface allows you to restore the session:</p>

<pre><code>We protected your privacy by not sending any personal information to&#x000A;&lt;domain&gt;. If you want &lt;domain&gt; to receive private information, please&#x000A;select:&#x000A;&#x000A;Choices: [ Do not send private information     | ▼ ]&#x000A;         | Use a previous session for &lt;domain&gt; |&#x000A;         | Use session from bookmark "&lt;name&gt;"  |&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p>If you can see other use cases, please comment on that.</p>

<p>From these use cases, I can infer three kind of sessions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Live sessions, currently in use</li>
<li>Saved sessions, associated to a bookmark</li>
<li>Closed sessions in the past, accessible using history. Collected after a too
long time.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, how to implement that? I was thinking of QtWebKit as I already worked with
Qt and it's easy to work with.</p>

<ul>
<li>We have a main widget: <code>QWebView</code>. We want to change the session when a new
page is loaded. So we hook up with the signal <code>loadStarted</code>.</li>
<li>We prevent history related CSS rules by implementing <code>QWebHistoryInterface</code>,
more specifically, we store the history necessary to implement
<code>QWebHistoryInterface</code> in the session.</li>
<li>We change the cache by implementing <code>QAbstractNetworkCache</code> and setting it
using <code>view-&gt;page()-&gt;networkAccessManager()-&gt;setCache(...)</code></li>
<li>We change the cookie jar by implementing <code>QNetworkCookieJar</code> and setting it
using <code>view-&gt;page()-&gt;networkAccessManager()-&gt;setCookieJar(...)</code></li>
<li>Change the local storage path using a directory dedicated for the session
and using <code>view-&gt;page()-&gt;settings()-&gt;setLocalStoragePath(QString)</code></li>
</ul>


<p>After all that, we'll have to inspect the resulting browser to determine if
there are still areas where we fail at protecting privacy.</p>

  <p>Here is my <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=660340">Bug 660340</a>. I
created it after looking at the recent facebook 'enhancements' that makes
privacy even more precious (<a href="http://linuxfr.org/news/facebook-f8-timeline-musiquevid%C3%A9o-ticker-boutons-et-les-cons%C3%A9quences-pour-le-web">article in French</a>).</p>

<p>We need to quickly find a way to preserve our privacy on the Internet.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>With the recent threats of the various big internet companies on our privacy,
it would be a great enhancement if epiphany allowed to have separate navigation
contexts (cookies, HTML5 storage, cache) at will, and easily.</p>

<p>Some companies, especially facebook, and I suppose Google could do that as
well, can use all kind of methods to track a user usiquely. using cache, HTML5
storage or cookies. I wonder if they can use the cache as well, but I heard it
could be prevented. Firefox does.</p>

<p>One solution to counter these privacy threats is to have a different browser,
or different browser profile, for each of the web sites we load. This is
however very inconvenient, and it should made easily possible.</p>

<p>First let define the concept of session. A session is almost like a separate
instance of the browser. It share bookmark and preferences with other session,
but have separate cache, separate set of cookies and separate HTML5 DOM
storage.</p>

<p>I imagine the following behaviour, based on the document.domain of the toplevel
document:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If a page is loaded without referrer, and the domain is not associated with
an existing session, start a new session for that domain</p></li>
<li><p>If a page is loaded without referrer, and the domain is a domain that is
already associated with an existing session, then prompt non intrusively:</p>

<pre><code>"You already opened a session on example.com."&#x000A;Choices: [  Start a new session    ▼ ] [Use this session]&#x000A;         [[ New anonymous session   ]]&#x000A;         [  Replace existing session ]&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>If the session is started anonymously, it would not be considered for reuse</p></li>
<li><p>If a page is loaded using a link from an existing window/tab, and the
domain
is the same, then share the session</p></li>
<li><p>If a page is loaded using a link from an existing window/tab, and the
domain
is NOT the same and, then a non intrusive message is displayed:</p>

<pre><code>"You are now visiting example2.com. Do you want to continue your session&#x000A;from example1.com?"&#x000A;Choices: [  Start a new session    ▼ ] [Share previous session]&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>The "Start a new session" dropdown menu changes if the example2.com is
already associated with a session or not. If example2.com is associated
with a session:</p>

<pre><code> [[ New anonymous session            ]]&#x000A; [  Replace example2.com session      ]&#x000A; [  Use existing example2.com session ]&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>If example2.com is not associated with a session:</p>

<pre><code> [[ New anonymous session    ]]&#x000A; [  New example2.com session  ]&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p>The choices in [[xxx]] (as opposed to [xxx]) is the most privacy enhancing one,
and would be the default if the user choose in the preferences</p>

<pre><code>[x] allow me not to be tracked&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>The messages are non intrusive, they can be displayed as a banner on top of the
page. The page is first loaded with the default choice, and if the user decides
to use the other choice, the page will be reloaded accordingly (or the session
will be reassigned).</p>

<p>This setting can traditionally be used to set the do not track header</p>

<p>Every settings should have a setting "do not prompt me again" that could be
reset at some point.</p>

<p>About embedded content: Because toplevel pages do not share the same session
(toplevel page opened at example.com have a different session than toplevel
page opened at blowmyprivacy.org), if a page from example.com have embedded
content from blowmyprivacy.org, the embedded content would not be able to track
the user, except within the example.com website.</p>

<p>It is possible to imagine global settings that would hide some complexity:</p>

<pre><code>[ ] When I load a page, always associate it with its existing session.&#x000A;[ ] When I switch website, always reuse the existing session of the new&#x000A;    website.&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>This user interface might seem complex at first, but it is far less complex
than letting the user deal with different browser profiles by hand.
Unfortunately, I don't think we can abstract privacy that easily. Keep in mind
that all of these settings would be enabled only if the user choose to enable
privacy settings.</p>

<p>I am ready to contribute to the implementation of this highly important feature
(important for our future and our privacy). Do you think an extension might be
able to do all of that, or do you think the browser code should be modified?</p>

<p>Further possible enhancements:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add another choice for anonymous sessions using Tor (or I2P)</p></li>
<li><p>Add the possibility to have multiple session registered with the same
domain. This would enable the user to have different profiles for the same
website.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="excerpt">
  <p>First postulate: HTML was designed as a stateless protocol</p>

<p>Context: web sites need to maintain a context (or state) to track the client.
This is required by the log-in procedures the various websites have. It is also
useful to track the user in a web store, to know which items the user wants to
buy. In fact, it is requires almost everywhere.</p>

<p>The first solution to be thrown out for this problem are the cookies. People
didn't like cookies but now, everyone accepts them. Nothing works without
cookies. Why did people dislike cookies back then? They liked their provacy and
cookies makes it possible to track the user. Through advertisement networks, the
advertiser known exactly which website the user visited. And it is still the
case now. What changed is that the users got tried to fight cookies and have
every website break, and they got used to it.</p>

<p><strong>People got used to being tracked</strong> just as people are used to be watched by
video cameras in the street and people are used to get tracked by the government
and big companies and banks.</p>

<p>Cookies are a great way to track prople, all because HTTP didn't include session
management. The way Google track you is very simple. Google Analytics puts a
cookie on your computer and each time you access the Google Server, they know
it's the same person. Google is everywhere:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many web sites are using Google APIs, or the jQuery library at Google.</li>
<li>Many web sites ask Google to track their users to know how many prople visit
their page.</li>
<li>Google makes advertisement.</li>
<li>Youtube, Blogger, Picasa and others are owned by Google</li>
</ul>


<p>With this alone, Google is found on almost every page. If you have an account at
Google (YouTube, Picase, Gmail, Blogger, Android or other), they can even give a
name or an e-mail address to all of these information.</p>

<p>Google motto is <em>Don't be Evil</em>, they are perhaps not evil but can they become
evil? Yes.</p>

<p>Whatever, my dream HTTP 2.0 protocol would include of course push support like
WebSockets, but more importantly: session management. How should this be done?</p>

<h3>HTTP and Session Management</h3>

<p><strong>When the server needs a session, it initiates the session by giving a session
token to the client.</strong> The client needs to protect this token from being stolen
and should display that a session is in pogress for this website. It could
appear on the URL bar for example. The client could close the session at any
moment.</p>

<p>With the token, the server provides its validity scope. Domains, subdomains,
path. Only the resources in the session scope will receive the tocken back. If
for example <code>http://example.com</code> starts a session at <code>example.com</code> but have an
<code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> that includes facebook. Facebook won't receive the session token. If
Facebook wants to start a session (because the user wants to log-in) it will
start a second session.</p>

<p>Session cannot escape the page. If you have two tabs open with facebook in each
tab (either full page or embedded), the two facebook instances don't share the
same session, unless the user explicitely allowed this. For instance, when
Facebook starts a session, the browser could tell the user that Facebook already
have an existing session and the user would be free to choose between the new
session and the existing one.</p>

<h3>How does this solve XSS</h3>

<p>XSS is when a website you don't trust access the session of a website you trust,
and steal it. At least I think so.</p>

<p>With this kind of session management, the session couldn't possibly be stolen.
Suppose that the non-trusted site makes an XmlHttpRequest to gmail.com. If
cross-domain wasn't forbidden, any web-site could read your mails.</p>

<p>With the new session management, if the untrusted site makes a request to
gmail.com, gmail.com session wouldn't be available and the login page would be
returned instead of the list of e-mails. If the non trusted website tries to
log-in, you would be prompted to associate the Gmail session with the site you
don't trust. If you aren't completely idion, you wouldn't allow the online
pharmacy to connect to Gmail.</p>

<h3>Extra</h3>

<p><strong>What is known about you?</strong> Let's take an average person that uses her credit
card, have and Android phone with Gmail, uses Facebook:</p>

<ul>
<li>All your relationships are known by Google (Gmail, Google+) and Facebook</li>
<li>All your interests are known by Google and Facebook (Ad Sense track which
website you visit and Facebook have a huge profile on you)</li>
<li>All your posessions are known to your bank</li>
<li>Your photograph is known by Google and Facebook (people probably took a
photo of you and placed it on their Android phone synchronized with Google)</li>
<li>Your location is known (using your Android phone, your credit card, or your
RFID card you use for public transportation)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>


<p>If you ever want to keep private, it is becoming very difficult.</p>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/mildred/Lysaac">Lysaac</a> is my reimplementation of the <a href="http://lisaac-users.org">lisaac</a>
compiler. Until now, it wasn't very interesting to look at, but recently, I
pushed a few interesting commits:</p>

<ul>
<li>you now have variables

<ul>
<li>the default value is initialized correctly</li>
<li>the read works</li>
<li>the write works</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you also have BLOCKs (sorry, no upvalues for now)</li>
</ul>


<p>This may looks like nothing, but under the hood, the infrastructure is almost
completely there.</p>

<p>Next thing to come: inheritance and error reporting.</p>

<p>Then perhaps, syntax improvements like keyword messages and later: operators.
For now, I want the basic functionnality working well.</p>

<p>If you want to play with it, you can. If you get an error, create a use-case and
propose it as a new feature. Please use as a model <a href="https://github.com/mildred/Lysaac/blob/master/features/type/struct.feature">the <code>.feature</code> files</a>.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <p>I always wanted to manage the files in my home directory. Generally, it's a
complete mess and I wanted to get things right and understand the files I had.</p>

<p>At first, I just created a simple shell script that maintained symbolic links of
the dotfiles and dordirs of my homedirs to <code>.local/config</code>, sort of early XDG
configuration directory. I also changed my .bashrc and later .zshrc to point to
files in <code>.local/etc/profile.d</code>. The shell script was reading a database in
<code>.local/config/database.sh</code> that contained the link information in the form.</p>

<p>The script did the following for each file declared:</p>

<ul>
<li>if the file existed in the homedir but not in the database directory, it was
simply moved and a link was created in its place.</li>
<li>if the file existed at both places, tell there is a conflict.</li>
<li>if the file existed in the database directory but not in the homedir, create
the link</li>
</ul>


<p>The database looks like:</p>

<pre><code>link ".bashrc" "bashrc"&#x000A;link ".zshrc"  "zshrc"&#x000A;&#x000A;# First file in home directory&#x000A;# Second file in .local/config&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>My script just defined a function <code>link</code> and sourced the database. But links
were not easy to construct in shell. So later, I decided to rewrite it in Tcl,
simply because the syntax is compatible (I love the Tcl syntax for that) and
because of the wonderful <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/file.htm">file</a> command.</p>

<p>Later, I improved the script that was then called <code>fixdir</code> to list which files
were not managed, and display them. So I could either delete those files
(because I don't care about them) or integrate them in the database. The script
gained a <code>clean</code> command to automatically remove files declared as noisy.</p>

<p>Now, I have a slightly different problem. I have now different computers which
do not have all the same configuration. At first, I synchronized everything and
just used the hostname in the database to get different links depending on the
machine. But now, with my computer at work, I will not synchronize all the
personal configurations. i have to get to a modular approach.</p>

<p>And this script did not help me in tracking what programs I installed in
<code>~/.local/{bin,share,lib}</code>. For this, I wanted something like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/index.html">stow</a>. I
tried using stow, but it failed with a conflict. Then I tried using
<a href="https://github.com/docwhat/homedir">homedir</a>. I just didn't like it because it created an ugly <code>~/bin</code>
instead of <code>~/.local/bin</code>.</p>

<p>Then I realized my <code>fixdir</code> script looks much like <code>homedir</code> already, and I
patched it up to make it better. And there it is.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mildred/fixdir">The current version of fixdir is on github.</a></p>

<p>Let me copy the README file:</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>This is my homedir package manager. Written first in shell then translated in
tcl. Originally, this was just to maintain a set of symbolic links from my home
directory to a directory where all important comfig files were stored. Then I
decided to make it a package manager.</p>

<h2>How to install it?</h2>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/mildred/fixdir.git fixdir&#x000A;fixdir_dir="$(pwd)/fixdir"&#x000A;cd&#x000A;"$fixdir_dir/fixdir" install "$fixdir_dir/hpkg.tcl"&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p><code>fixdir</code> is installed in <code>~/.local/bin</code>. Make sure it is in your <code>$PATH</code>.</p>

<h2>How does it work</h2>

<p><code>fixdir</code> works better when you are in your target directory (homedir)</p>

<p>Invoke one action with a database file. The database file is a tcl script that
contain all files and directories that should be linked.</p>

<h2>What else can it do?</h2>

<p><code>fixdir unknown</code> list all files not manages by fixdir in the current directory</p>

<p><code>fixdir clean</code> remove files declared as noisy</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li>fixdir list doesn't work when pwd != target directory</li>
</ul>
