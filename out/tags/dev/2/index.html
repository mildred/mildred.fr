<div class='excerpt'>
  <p>What is this all about: web privacy. We are tracked everywhere, and i'd like to
help if possible. So, let's design a web browser that for once respects your
privacy.</p>

<p>Main features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each website has its own cookie jar, its own cache and its own HTML5 local
storage</li>
<li>History related css attributes are disabled</li>
<li>External plugins are only enabled on demand</li>
<li>Support for Tor/I2P is enabled by default</li>
<li>You have complete control over who receives what information</li>
<li>Let's you control in the settings if you want to allow referrers or not.</li>
<li>The contextual menu let's you open links anonymously (no referrer, anonymous
session)</li>
</ul>


<p>The browser is bundled with a particular UI that let you control everything
during your browsing session. it is non intrusive and makes the best choice by
default. I am thinking of a notification bar that shows at the bottom. I noticed
that this place is not intrusive when I realized that the search bar in Firefox
was most of the time open, even if most of the time I didn't use it.</p>

<p>First, let's define a session:</p>

<ul>
<li>A session can be used my more than one domain at the same time.</li>
<li>A session is associated to a specific cache storage</li>
<li>A session is associated to a specific HTML5 storage</li>
<li>A session is associated to a specific cookie jar</li>
<li>A session acn be closed. When it is closed, session cookies are deleted from
the session</li>
<li>A session can be reopened. All long lasting cookies, cache, HTML5 storage
and such is then used again.</li>
<li>A session can be anonymous. In such a case, the session is deleted
completely when it is closed.</li>
<li>A session is associated to none, one or more domains. These domains are the
domains the end user can see in the address bar, not the sub items in the
page.</li>
</ul>


<p>Sessions are like Firefox profiles. If you iopen a new session, it's like you
opened a new Firefox profile you just created. Because people will never create
a different Firefox profile for each site.</p>

<p>If we want to protect privacy, when a link is opened, a new session should be
created each time. To make it usable to browse web sites, it is made possible to
share sessions in specific cases. Let's define the cases where it might be
intelligent to share a profile:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You click a link or submit a form and expect to still be logged-in in the
site you are viewing. You don't care if you follow a link to an external
page.</p>

<p>User Interface: If the link matches one of the domains of the session, then
keep the session. No UI. If the user wanted a new session, the "Open
anonymously" entry in the context menu exists. A button on the toolbar might
be available to enter a state where we always want to open links
anonymously.</p>

<p>If the link points to another domain, then open the link in a new session
unless "Open in the same session" was specified in the context menu. The UI
contains:</p>

<pre><code>We Protected your privacy by separating &lt;domain of the new site&gt; from&#x000A;the site you were visiting previously (&lt;domain of the previous site&gt;).&#x000A;&#x000A;Choices: [ (1) Create a new anonymous session          | ▼ ]&#x000A;         | (2) Continue session from &lt;previous domain&gt; |&#x000A;         | (3) Use a previous session for &lt;new domain&gt; |&#x000A;         | (4) Use session from bookmark "&lt;name&gt;"      |&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>The first choice is considered the default and the page is loaded with it.
If the user chooses a new option, then the page is reloaded.</p>

<p>If the user chooses (2), the page is reloaded with the previous session and
the user will be asked if "Do you want <old domain> and <new domain> to have
access to the same private information about you?". Answers are Yes, No and
Always. If the answer is Always, then in the configuration, the two domains
are considered one and the same.</p>

<p>The choice (3) will use the most recent session for the new domain. It might
be a session currently in use or a session in the history.</p>

<p>There are as many (4) options as there are bookmarks for the new domain. If
different bookmarks share a single session, only one bookmark is shown. This
choice will load the session from the bookmark.</p>

<p>If (3) and (4) are the same sessions, and there is only one bookmark (4),
then the (4) option is left out.</p></li>
<li><p>You use a bookmark and expect to continue the session you had for this
bookmark (webmails)</p>

<p>The session is simpely stored in the bookmark. When saving a bookmark, there
is an option to store the session with it or not.</p>

<pre><code>[X] Do not save any personal information with this bookmark&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You open a new URL and you might want reuse a session that was opened for
this URL.</p>

<p>The User Interface allows you to restore the session:</p>

<pre><code>We protected your privacy by not sending any personal information to&#x000A;&lt;domain&gt;. If you want &lt;domain&gt; to receive private information, please&#x000A;select:&#x000A;&#x000A;Choices: [ Do not send private information     | ▼ ]&#x000A;         | Use a previous session for &lt;domain&gt; |&#x000A;         | Use session from bookmark "&lt;name&gt;"  |&#x000A;</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p>If you can see other use cases, please comment on that.</p>

<p>From these use cases, I can infer three kind of sessions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Live sessions, currently in use</li>
<li>Saved sessions, associated to a bookmark</li>
<li>Closed sessions in the past, accessible using history. Collected after a too
long time.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, how to implement that? I was thinking of QtWebKit as I already worked with
Qt and it's easy to work with.</p>

<ul>
<li>We have a main widget: <code>QWebView</code>. We want to change the session when a new
page is loaded. So we hook up with the signal <code>loadStarted</code>.</li>
<li>We prevent history related CSS rules by implementing <code>QWebHistoryInterface</code>,
more specifically, we store the history necessary to implement
<code>QWebHistoryInterface</code> in the session.</li>
<li>We change the cache by implementing <code>QAbstractNetworkCache</code> and setting it
using <code>view-&gt;page()-&gt;networkAccessManager()-&gt;setCache(...)</code></li>
<li>We change the cookie jar by implementing <code>QNetworkCookieJar</code> and setting it
using <code>view-&gt;page()-&gt;networkAccessManager()-&gt;setCookieJar(...)</code></li>
<li>Change the local storage path using a directory dedicated for the session
and using <code>view-&gt;page()-&gt;settings()-&gt;setLocalStoragePath(QString)</code></li>
</ul>


<p>After all that, we'll have to inspect the resulting browser to determine if
there are still areas where we fail at protecting privacy.</p>

<div class='excerpt'>
  <p>Hi everyone, I just developed a new way to update my blog. I am just
using my mailer (which is currently Thunderbird for a lack of a better
alternative). As you may know, I already manage my own server. I have a
nginx web server and my website is just plain old static pages generated
from markdown using my own version of webgen.</p>

<p>My code is available at two locations:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://git.mildred.fr">my personal git server</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/mildred/">github</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I just developed a few scripts which does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>hooked in /etc/aliases, receive e-mail from a special e-mail address.
Put this mail in an inbox directory on the server</li>
<li>another daemon (a shell script run by daemontools actually) run as the
www-data user is monitoring the inbox using inotifywait. When a mail
comes, or every 60 seconds, it process the mail using a ruby script that
convert the mail to a markdown page, and run webgen on the website. It
also commit and push the changes.</li>
</ul>


<p>And that's all.</p>

<p>The one thing I couldn't automate is the creation of the private key to
push the changes back to the git server.</p>

<p>All the code <a href="http://git.mildred.fr/?p=pub/mildred/wwwsupport.git;a=summary">is
there</a>. I
just don't know if I have a public URl for these repos :)</p>

  <p>I was looking at Git, and which features may land in the next few
releases, and I found the following things:</p>

<h2>Git-SVN will be completely redesigned</h2>

<p>If you worked with git-svn, you probably know that the git-svn workflow
has nothing to do with git. Basically, you just have the svn history and
have to use git-svn to push the changes back to the subversion
repository. You can't use git-push and that's really annoying.</p>

<p>Recently, the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote-helpers.html">git-remote-helpers</a> feature was
added. It allows git to interact with any kind of remote url, using a
specific <code>git-remote-*</code> command. For example, you can already use
mercurial this way (according to <a href="https://github.com/rfk/git-remote-hg">git-remote-hg</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>Git allows pluggable remote repository protocols via helper scripts. If you have a script named "git-remote-XXX" then git will use it to interact with remote repositories whose URLs are of the form XXX::some-url-here. So you can imagine what a script named git-remote-hg will do.</p>

<p>Yes, this script provides a remote repository implementation that communicates with mercurial. Install it and you can do:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone hg::https://hg.example.com/some-mercurial-repo&#x000A;$ cd some-mercurial-repo&#x000A;$ # hackety hackety hack&#x000A;$ git commit -a&#x000A;$ git push&#x000A;</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>The plan is to do the same with subversion. You could just do:</p>

<pre><code> $ git clone svn::http://svn.host.org/repo/trunk/&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>Branches might be tricky to implement, they might not be there. But you
will get what's already in git-svn but with a way better UI. And far
more possibilities for the future.</p>

<p>Here is the summary from the <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/SoC2011Projects#Remote_helper_for_Subversion_and_git-svn">GSoc</a> page:</p>

<blockquote><p>The submodule system of git is very powerful, yet not that easy to work with. This proposed work will strengthen the submodule system even more and improve the user experience when working with submodules.</p>

<p>Git repository: https://github.com/iveqy/git</p>

<p>Midterm evaluation: passed</p>

<p>Progress report / status:</p>

<ul>
<li>[GSoC 11] submodule improvements at git mailing list</li>
<li>[GSoC 11 submodule] Status update at git mailing list</li>
<li>[RFC PATCH] Move git-dir for submodules at git mailing list</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Submodules will be improved a lot</h2>

<p>I wish it was already there. From the <a href="https://github.com/jlehmann/git-submod-enhancements/wiki/">wiki page</a>, the
improvements will be:</p>

<blockquote><p>As Dscho put it, submodules are the “neglected ugly duckling” of git. Time to change that …</p>

<p>Issues still to be tackled in this repo:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let am, bisect, checkout, checkout-index, cherry-pick, merge, pull, read-tree, rebase, reset &amp; stash work recursively on submodules (in progress)</li>
<li>Teach grep the --recursive option</li>
<li>Add means to specify which submodules shall be populated on clone</li>
<li>Showing that a submodule has a HEAD not on any branch in “git status”</li>
<li>gitk: Add popup menu for submodules to see the detailed history of changes</li>
<li>Teach “git prune” the “--recurse-submodules” option (and maybe honour the same default and options “git fetch” uses)</li>
<li>Better support for displaying merge conflicts of submodules</li>
<li>git gui: Add submodule menu for adding and fetching submodules</li>
<li>git status should call “git diff --submodule --ignore-submodules=dirty” instead of “git submodule summary” for providing a submodule summary when configured to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Add an “always-tip” mode</strong></li>
<li>Other commands that could benefit from a “--recurse-submodules” option: archive, branch, clean, commit, revert, tag.</li>
<li>In the long run git-submodule.sh should be converted to a rather simple wrapper script around core git functionality as more and more of that is implemented in the git core.</li>
</ul>


<p>Submodule related bugs to fix</p>

<ul>
<li>Cherry picking across submodule creation fails even if the cherry pick doesn’t touch any file in the submodules path</li>
<li>git submodule add doesn’t record the url in .git/config when the submodule path doesn’t exist.</li>
<li>git rebase --continue won’t work if the commit only contains submodule changes.</li>
</ul>

<div class='excerpt'>
  <p>I started writing wwwgen: a website generator that uses redo for its
dependency tracking. Unfortunately, I might not have taken the correct
approach to the problem. I reuse the webgen concepts, and that might be
a bad idea.</p>

<p>Specifically, webgen (and my first version of wwwgen) are bottom-up
systems (you take the sources and build everything they can generate).
The problem is that redo itself is top-down (you take the target and
build it, building sources as they are needed), and I tried to make the
two match. It's very difficult, and impossible to do with a clean design.</p>

<p>What I'd like to have is a simple <code>wwwgen</code> binary that generates a HTML
file from a source file. Let's imagine how it could work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the source file is a simple page with no templates, just generate
the HTML and this is it</p></li>
<li><p>If the source file is a simple page with a template, redo-ifchange the
template source and build the HTML combining the two</p></li>
<li><p>If the source file is an index, we have a problem because multiple
outputs are generated. Redo doesn't support this case and we must find a
way to make it work.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So, we have a problem here ...</p>

<p>Now, we have another problem. Specifically, my source file is called
<code>title.page</code> and I want my output file to be <code>title/index.html</code>. In
webgen, this is implemented by a configuration in <code>title.page</code> telling
it to build in <code>title/index.html</code>.</p>

<p>There is a solution to solve both problems at once. the wwwgen command
creates an archive (the formats needs to be defined, it could be tar, or
different yaml documents in the same file for example). Then, the build
process would be:</p>

<p><strong>all.do</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> find src -name "*.src" \&#x000A;   | sed 's/src$/gen/' \&#x000A;   | xargs -d '\n' redo-ifchange&#x000A; find src -name "*.gen" \&#x000A;   | xargs -d '\n' wwwgen unpack&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p><strong>default.gen.do</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> redo-ifchange "$2.src"&#x000A; wwwgen --redo-dependencies -o "$3" generate "$2.src"&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p><code>wwwgen generate</code> would parse the source file and generate an archive,
that will be unpacked later by <code>wwwgen unpack</code>. Let's see how it can work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The source file can choose where it unpacks, relatively to the
directory where the source file is</p></li>
<li><p>If the source file is an index, it will redo-ifchange the other source
files for the index and redo-ifchange the template, generate multiple
pages packed together.</p></li>
<li><p>If the source file is a tag tree (a special source that doesn't output
anything on its own but create index files dynamically), then it parses
every child to find a canonical list of tags and the paths they refer
to. Then, it creates the index files. Unfortunately, those index files
will never be compiled until next build.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>How an we improve the design to be able to create source files dynamically.</p>

<p>There are different views to the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>pages, index and tags should all generate all the output files they
are related to. It means that index files should be able to generate
pages, and tags should be able to generate indexes and pages.</p></li>
<li><p>pages should generate the output file, index should generate pages and
feeds and tags should generate index.</p></li>
<li><p>mixed solution (the one described): pages generate output file, index
should generate the output files as well and tags generates index.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>How can we generate source files on the fly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>have a predefined compilation order: first tags, then index and lastly
feeds and pages.</p></li>
<li><p>rebuild everything until no more source files are generated. We might
build unnecessary things.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I prefer the second solution which is more flexible, but we need a way
to avoid building things twice. For example, it's not necessary to build
a page if on the next phase the page source is going to be regenerated.</p>

<p>Very simply, the generated page can contain a link to the index source
file that generated it, and when generating the page, <code>redo-ifchange</code> is
run on the index file.</p>

<p>Next question: what if a tag is deleted. The corresponding index page is
going to stay around until the next clean. The tag page should keep
around a list of index files it generated and delete them when a tag is
no longer detected. And deleting the index should not be done using <code>rm</code>
because the index will need to delete the pages it generated. The best
solution would be to integrate to redo to detect these files.</p>

<p>The build scripts now are:</p>

<p><strong>all.do</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> oldsrclist=&#x000A; srclist="$(find src -name "*.src")"&#x000A; while [ "$oldsrclist" != "$srclist" ]; do&#x000A;   echo "$srclist" \&#x000A;     | sed 's/src$/gen/' \&#x000A;     | xargs -d '\n' redo-ifchange&#x000A;   oldsrclist="$srclist"&#x000A;   srclist="$(find src -name "*.src")"&#x000A; done&#x000A;&#x000A; find src -name "*.gen" \&#x000A;   | xargs -d '\n' wwwgen unpack&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p><strong>default.gen.do</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> redo-ifchange "$2.src"&#x000A; wwwgen --redo-dependencies -o "$3" generate "$2.src"&#x000A;</code></pre>

  <h2>The overlooked problem</h2>

<p>Let me explain the reason why I think Lisaac is broken and why I stopped
working on it. The fundamental concept behind it is completely broken,
and i never could solve the problem. First, let me explain a few things
about Lisaac:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is statically typed (like Eiffel)</li>
<li>It is prototype based (like Self)</li>
</ul>


<p>It may not seem like it but those two things are mutually exclusive,
unless something is done to reconcile the two. Being statically typed
means you know the type (or a parent of the real type) at compile-time.
Being prototype based means that the type can change completely.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a <code>CUCUMBER</code> that inherit <code>VEGETABLE</code>. If at some point
during run-time, the cucumber inherit <code>SOFTWARE</code> (yes, cucumber is the
name of a software as well) you have a problem. Yet, this is not the
problem I want to talk about.</p>

<p>Lisaac solve this problem because you can only assign a child type as a
parent. In the following object:</p>

<pre><code> Section Header&#x000A;   + name := CUCUMBER;&#x000A; Section Inherit&#x000A;   + parent :VEGETABLE := ...;&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>So, you're forbidden to assign a <code>SOFTWARE</code> in the <code>parent</code> slot because
<code>SOFTWARE</code> is not a child of <code>VEGETABLE</code>. But, you're allowed to assign
a <code>GREEN_VEGETABLE</code>. So not it becomes:</p>

<pre><code> Section Header&#x000A;   + name := CUCUMBER;&#x000A; Section Inherit&#x000A;   + parent :VEGETABLE := GREEN_VEGETABLE;&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's say you send a message to your cucumber, and through the
magic of inheritance, you end up in a slot of the parent. That is, you
are executing code that is located in <code>GREEN_VEGETABLE</code>. Then, you have
a problem.</p>

<pre><code> Section Header&#x000A;   + name := GREEN_VEGETABLE;&#x000A; Section Public&#x000A;   // inherited from VEGETABLE&#x000A;   - do_something &lt;- paint_it_green;&#x000A; Section Private&#x000A;   // specific to GREEN_VEGETABLE&#x000A;   - paint_it_green &lt;- ( "green".println; );&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>In the code above, if you are executing the <code>do_something</code> slot and have
<code>SELF = CUCUMBER</code>, you can't possibly call the <code>paint_it_green</code> slot
because it does not exist in <code>CUCUMBER</code>, and the Lisaac compiler will
refuse to compile your code. To explain it another way, the type of
<code>Self</code> is not compatible with <code>GREEN_VEGETABLE</code>, and this is a problem
for this is the code we are executing. You can't easily solve this problem.</p>

<p>In the Self language, if you had a similar situation, it would work
because it is not statically typed. It would have failed to find
<code>paint_in_green</code> in the cucumber and called the parent, which would have
been a green vegetable. Somehow, the type of the cucumber would have
changed at runtime, which is incompatible with a type system that can
only compute types at compile time (and have them immutable at run time).</p>

<h2>So, I stopped working on Lisaac</h2>

<p>I tried to start up a new project, Lysaac, but got confronted to the
same problem once the compiler was mature enough to start getting into
inheritance. So I stopped again.
<a href="http://pesn.com/2012/09/02/9602175_Waking_Up_is_Hard_to_Do/">Life getting in the way</a> didn't help.</p>

<h2>A new hope</h2>

<p>I tried to look into virtual machines, convincing myself that compiled
languages couldn't possibly answer such need to dynamic things in the
language. I looked at Self for the first time. I tried to build a
virtual machine that was fully concurrent. I looked at the Go language
because I know that it has nice concurrent primitives ... and I found
illumination.</p>

<p>The Go language feels like a dynamic language, but it is compiled. I
always wondered how it could implement duck typing, and I <a href="http://research.swtch.com/interfaces">found
out</a>. I also realized that the difference between a virtual machine
with a JIT compiler, and a runtime for a compiled language that included
a compiler was very narrow. Basically, nothing prevents any language
from being compiled instead of being JIT compiled. You just have to
include a compiler in the standard library.</p>

<p>Ironically, that what Common Lisp is doing.</p>

<h2>A new language</h2>

<p>I like how Go implements interfaces, and I want to do the same. In this
new language, an object is composed of :</p>

<ul>
<li>an opaque work (pointer sized)</li>
<li>a pointer to an interface</li>
</ul>


<p>An interface is a collection of pointers to functions. There is always a
pointer for the fallback implementation and a pointer for the case
operation (to case an object to a new interface).</p>

<p>I want to use a smalltalk/Io type syntax. So the following will
represent an object with one variable and one slot:</p>

<pre><code> obj := {&#x000A;   var := obj slot;&#x000A;   slot &lt;- { ... };&#x000A; }&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>The data word of obj would be a pointer to a struct containing the
variable "var"
The interface of obj would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a function pointer for the fallback implementation that throws an error</li>
<li>a function pointer for the "cast" operation</li>
<li>a function pointer for the "slot" slot</li>
</ul>


<p>I haven't figured out yet how to pass parameters to functions and return
objects. This kind of things will require to comply to predefined
interfaces (we need a way to tell which object type is returned by a
slot for example). Interfaces would probably be defined at compile time
and available as constants in code at run time (to be given as parameter
to the cast slot).</p>

<p>If I want to be able to compile on the fly the code, I need to include
the LLVM library. So I need to implement the language in a language that
is compiled using LLVM (so bootstraping will be easier).</p>
