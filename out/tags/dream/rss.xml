      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a strange dream ... of another dream. When I woke up in the first dream I wanted to create a Scratchpad to write the second dream on. Here is it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three characters: Anna from the White Ajah, Jessica from the Red and Patrul R. who was also a musician of some sort. The day before, I (Anna) said goodbye to Patrul R. He felt somethng would be happening as he gave his blessing with a long kiss. Rightly so, the next morning, Anna had a bus accident and her conciousness transferred to Jessica.&lt;/p&gt;
