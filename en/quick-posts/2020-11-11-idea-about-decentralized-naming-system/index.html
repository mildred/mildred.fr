<h2 id="genesis">Genesis</h2>

<p>I was investigating PeerTube vs LBRY as YouTube alternative, and I came to a
mixed conclusion:</p>

<ul>
<li>LBRY seems more popular in the content creators I follow</li>
<li>With PeerTube you own the data you publish</li>
<li>With LBRY, a simple PC with the app left open is enough to publish content for
non tech people</li>
<li>With PeerTube you can be censored from the Fediverse as it happened already
with <a href="http://gab.com">Gab</a>. I also heard that some PeerTube instances were
enforcing a COVID19 policy, how long before this policy is enforced in
PeerTube peering?</li>
<li>With LBRY, there is no censorship possible, but you cannot take down illegal
content</li>
<li>LBRY can only work because of a blockchain where you need to spend LBC tokens
for every action (except looking at the content). You need coin to create a
channel, create a content, publish a comment. For the moment LBRY Inc is
liberally giving out credits, but how can it work long term?</li>
</ul>

<p>LBRY makes use of its coin to claim a name. For content publishing, it uses a
BitTorrent-like protocol. The blockchain serves as a database for all the
available content, and content is indexed by name which requires LBC to
register.</p>

<p>Thus, I&rsquo;m thinking at solutions to avoid this blockchain, and because the issue
is with name claiming, I&rsquo;m thinking about a generic solution to that problem.
That could also help with DNS.</p>

<p>Also, LBRY name claiming is quite ingenious. Instead of spending a fixed amount
of coins to register a name, you block an amount of coins, and you can get back
your coins when you decide to unregister the name you claimed. If a name is
popular, someone else can bid a higher amount on the same name and there is a
system that takes into account the duration you had the name in possession that
may eventually award the name to the highest bidder. It&rsquo;s a better scheme than
first come first served.</p>

<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Blockchains is great to build consensus, but there is no need to have coins on
top of them. Merkle-trees can be constructed with arbitrary data in it and there
is no need to reuse the Bitcoin code and logic that much.</p></li>

<li><p>Proof of Work is mostly there to avoid Sybil attack. However there exists the
Duniter project that aims at creating a free money system that has a web of
trust ensuring that for each registered account, there is a unique human behind.
Reusing this, we can ensure that participants in a blockchain are unique humans.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="naming-system">Naming system</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>A blockchain database where each block can contain:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A name registration, associated with any kind of data (limited in length).
It could be an IP address, a Torrent(-like) hash or anything really. A
public key and duration will be associated with each registration.</p></li>

<li><p>a name revocation that can happen automatically (by forging nodes) when a
name expires or manually (with a signed revocation document)</p></li>

<li><p>a forger key signed by a human member</p></li>

<li><p>a forger key revocation</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Blocks also contain reference to a previous block, universal time, block
count, hash, forger identification and signature</p></li>

<li><p>Blockchain forgers that are freely providing the service.</p>

<ul>
<li>A forger has a unique key pair, each block is signed by the forger key</li>
<li>The public key must be signed by a Duniter/Ğ1 active member</li>
<li>The key expires when the above signature expires, when the Duniter/Ğ1
member expires or when a revocation document is published</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Forgers are sharing pending operations that must be included in the next block</p></li>

<li><p>Deterministic algorithm decides who should forge the next block among the
active forgers. If a block is not forged, the next forger decided by the
algorithm should forge the block in a next timeslot.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This might be the most difficult and a proof of work might help not having two
  blocks created concurrently.</p>

<ul>
<li>Anyone can submit to any forger a pending operation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="resolve-name-squatting">Resolve name squatting</h3>

<p>A name bidding system can be added on top of that where some Ğ1 money is left on
a Ğ1 non member account. The name is valid as long as this account keeps its
money. If it is withdrawn, the name is no longer valid. Someone else could place
a bid with a higher amount on another account to claim the name.</p>

<h3 id="future-proof">Future-proof</h3>

<p>Blocks older than a year can be forgotten if every operation on the blockchain
has an expiration duration of a year. Forger public keys will need to be signed
again and name registered again. If you forging node is offline for more than a
year, it makes sense to resynchronize the full blockchain.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-operations-before-making-a-block-and-sharing-new-blocks">Sharing operations before making a block and sharing new blocks</h3>

<p>A flood algorithm might be needed. Bloom filters can come in handy.</p>

<h3 id="resolve-forks">Resolve forks</h3>

<p>Either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A deterministic algorithm decides which forger wins, the operations from the
diverging blocks operations are put back in the pending operations</p></li>

<li><p>A deterministic merge block is generated and published (not signed by a
forger, the merge block should be generated identically across all forgers)</p></li>
</ul>
