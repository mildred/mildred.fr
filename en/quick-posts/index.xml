      <description>Genesis I was investigating PeerTube vs LBRY as YouTube alternative, and I came to a mixed conclusion:
 LBRY seems more popular in the content creators I follow With PeerTube you own the data you publish With LBRY, a simple PC with the app left open is enough to publish content for non tech people With PeerTube you can be censored from the Fediverse as it happened already with Gab.</description>

      <description>Background I maintain a mail server at home, and to get its public IP address, I have a VPN on it (so it is independent on how I connect to the Internet). Recently I decided to update my home network router so I could connect directly to the server (instead of going out to the internet and back in via the VPN). I just added a static route to the public IP to using the private IP as gateway.</description>

      <title>Svelte for Nim</title>
      <link>http://mildred.fr/en/quick-posts/2020-04-30-svelte-with-nim/</link>

      <description>How can we combine Svelte.js with Nim as a language. More specifically, what I&amp;rsquo;d like to see is a web frontend micro-framework which:
 is written in Nim templates values into HTML does not do virtual dom is just a lib thanks to Nim macros, no framework (can emerald be used?) updates the DOM with DOM API calls rather than innerHTML and VDOM diffing  The idea is to get inspired by Svelte v2 which was simpler, and convert it to Nim.</description>

      <title>Upgrade Fedora Silverblue when you have rpmfusion packages</title>
      <link>http://mildred.fr/en/quick-posts/2019-04-07-upgrade-fedora-silverblue-with-rpmfusion/</link>

      <description>Upgrading Fedora Silverblue should be as easy as rebasing rpm-ostree to the new fedora ostree branch. It should be easy performed with:
sudo ostree remote gpg-import fedora-workstation -k /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora-30-primary sudo rpm-ostree rebase fedora-workstation:fedora/30/x86_64/silverblue  However, when you have RPMFusion layered packages, this can become a bit more complex, as rpm-ostree will try to layer fedora-29 packages on top of a fedora-30 ostree branch. This should fail with something like:
error: cannot update repo &#39;rpmfusion-free-updates&#39;: Cannot prepare internal mirrorlist: file &amp;quot;repomd.</description>

      <title>Namespaces in Consul/Nomad</title>

      <description>A namespace is a collection of nomad jobs in the same directory. Sub-directories are sub-namespaces. When instanciated, a namespace is allocated an identifier (8 character unique ID). Before being inserted in nomad, the jobs are modified to include this namespace identifier:
 the nomad job name is prefixed by &amp;ldquo;NAMESPACE-&amp;rdquo; (the namespace identifier) the consul service definitions are prefixed by &amp;ldquo;NAMESPACE-&amp;rdquo; (the namespace identifier) the services have an additional environment variable: CONSUL_NAMESPACE_ID  sub-namespaces are also inserted in the system when their parent namespace is inserted.</description>

      <title>HTTP/HTML subset for respecting privacy</title>

      <description>We can use HTTBy default, HTTP and HTML is not very respecting of our privacy. But, we could make it way better. Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine that out there, there will be some privacy-respecting web servers and browers, how could we do that?
 A privacy respecting browser should follow as much as possible the privacy subset of HTTP/HTML, and warn when websites do not respect this. The browser should sandbox web views that are not affiliated.</description>
