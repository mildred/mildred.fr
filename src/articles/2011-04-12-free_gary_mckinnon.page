Do you know how he did that? He just tested for accounts with empty passwords.
If you want to protect something valueable, you don't let it on a computer which
has remote access on the Internet with accounts not even protected by a
password.

How did he get caught? Just because he miscalculated timezones between UK and
US.

I don't want him to be extraded to the US. Why? Because I sincerely don't know
what he risks in the USA. [He fears Guantanamo][extradition], and he might be
right, knowing it [won't be closed][guantanamo] after all.

[Support site][support]

He aimed at uncovering secret files regarding UFO technology. At first, it might
seem silly, but when you look at [these testimonies][ufovideo] gathered by the
[Disclosure Project][disclosure], you might be sure that a few things are hidden
from the general public.

I love the USA people, but they have a shitty system.
