I ordered fish and chips without fish ... A nice way to order french fries and
salad. Because everyone is in Pattaya, I could discuss with other people, from
UK actually and Australia. Everyone is very nice and it's good to know I will
have people to talk to until the end.

Dr Suporn stopped surgeries for some time to take vacations, well deserved. So
he can spend time with his family. And as time passes, there is less and less
people around. This also means the clinic staff has more time and appointments
would often be earlier. That's why Aey came just when I started dilating this
morning. I left the door open for her (and wrote a note).
