I arrived to Thailand fine, that was yesterday around 6 am (local time). Just
add 5 hours to the European time (CEST) and you get the time in Thailand. The
plane was not so comfortable, considering you had to stay 11 hours in the same
seat, but the service was very good. We had a vegetarian meal so that we were
served first, and we got two of them. One at the departure, one at the arrival.
Plus a sandwich and drinks.

This was the occasion for me to watch the film *Prince of Persia* again, this
time in English. Fortunately, I already have seen this film, otherwise I might
not have understood much. The plane's noise was loud and covering the sound.
The same way, PA messages were difficult to hear and understand.

The plane landed fine and we went to the airport ... immigration followed by
collecting luggage, then we went to where the clinic staff awaited us. They were
very nice, and speaking a good English. When we left the airport, we were
assaulted by the air which was hot and wet. Not so surprising, but not usual for
us, Europeans. Then, off to the van, direction Chonburi, which was cold and dry
due to the air conditioning.

I received a letter welcoming me to Thailand and with the appointment times. All
very beautiful.

The landscape is very different than France, there are many more trees, but many
more buildings as well. All very wide. And the roads are huge. Did I mention
that they drive on the left of the road (and the wheel is on the right). This
might take some time getting used to, fortunately I don't have to drive.

We arrived at the hotel, and checked in. The room is spacious and good looking.
The only drawback is the mattress is not good quality at all, says Elie. It's an
old sprung mattress. Never mind.

I asked for Valerie's room but I didn't get the confirmation until 9 am, by
phone. At that time I was asleep, until noon. The afternoon, the program changed
and I had to do a complete physical checkup at 1:30 pm. I just had time to take
a shower, remove few offending hair and dress up until I went to see Valerie and
I had to hurry downstairs.

Bow accompanied us to the hospital and I had complete physical checkup. Blood
stampings, X-rays of the chest area and an electro-cardiogram. All went well,
except the confusion on my first name as ever. Shanti versus Dominique which is
the real first name (on the passport) but not my usual name. Anyway.

Then, I went to the clinic, and waited. I had the opportunity to rest a little,
and send a short e-mail before I had to go to see the clinic's psychiatrist. I
had to draw a person and a landscape, later describe them. And describe my
condition. How I was during childhood, ...

I received a beautiful booklet describing the operation and after-care, a
beautiful gift made of jasmine flowers and a box containing ... dilators. I then
went to my appointment with Dr Suporn.

He said that there was plenty of material and it should all go well. He
confirmed that my admission to the hospital was on Sunday afternoon and
explained the details of the operations.

We went back to the hotel, it was raining the 5pm rain. Very hot rain. We took
the van just to do 200 meters, I might argue on that. But I understand, we are
very well cared of here. We then visited the hotel and had an evening meal with
the other French patients around. And go to sleep.

I made it short, sorry, but it's already 12:30 pm and I still have to take a
shower.

Everyone is nice and very attentive. Today, I have the day off to visit, buy a
few essentials and contact everyone using the SIP account from free.fr that I
made work using the Twinkle software (Ekiga doesn't send your voice, I suppose
due to codec issues).
