[Lysaac][lysaac] is my reimplementation of the [lisaac](http://lisaac-users.org)
compiler. Until now, it wasn't very interesting to look at, but recently, I
pushed a few interesting commits:

  - you now have variables
      - the default value is initialized correctly
      - the read works
      - the write works
  - you also have BLOCKs (sorry, no upvalues for now)

This may looks like nothing, but under the hood, the infrastructure is almost
completely there.

Next thing to come: inheritance and error reporting.

Then perhaps, syntax improvements like keyword messages and later: operators.
For now, I want the basic functionnality working well.

If you want to play with it, you can. If you get an error, create a use-case and
propose it as a new feature. Please use as a model [the `.feature` files][feat].
